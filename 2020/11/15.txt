==================

what did you to do today?
-------------------------

- Waking up around 6:30am.
- Having a coffee (short macchiato) at the Foundation Cafe. The cafe is part of the Chch Public Library and they nice big stone tables outside.
- Create a CLI tool for building plaintext websites [[htps://github.com/stayradiated/plaintext]].
- Had a falafal pita for lunch in the park. Listening to the Lex Fridman interview with Grant Sanderson. Lots of great quotes.
- Back at the library. Continuing development on plaintext app. Added support for linking to files and custom HTML templates.
- Picked up some food for dinner from Pak'n'Save. The "California Wellness Bowl" from Naked Kitchen is pretty good cold on a hot day. Also snacking on peanut butter, dates and apples.
- Catching up with family over vidcall. 
- Watching Stranger Things s2e2 with Jo. What's up with all the gooey pumpkins?

Why does FB messenger audio not work on my laptop? It doesn't give me an option to choose the input device.

Thanks to Netlify, my journal is now available at https://journal.george.czabania.com.

It's a pretty cool system. I publish to my private journal repo, github actions updates the public journal repo and then Netlify builds the HTML site and hosts it.

Notes
-----

Calque (https://calque.io/) is a handy tool for doing quick calculations. I wish it support adding hours and durations.

Is there any tool that can do this?
Ideally it would be part of a repl.

  $ calc
  1h 45m + 3h 25m
  = 5h 10m

Gratitude
---------

I was sitting outside the library cafe with my laptop and a woman walking past complimented me on my posture. Receiving compliments feels good, I should give people compliments. I should also keep my back straight.
