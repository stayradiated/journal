=====================

- Cycling into work with Pete. The rear wheel on his back is a bit wobbly, but we aren't sure how to fix it. He should get it looked at by a professional.
- For lunch, I Went out to Subway. Ate in the park while listening to podcasts.
- Found someones keys on the sidewalk outside Subway. Walked back into the store and handed them in to the staff. Turns out they were the store managers keys!
- After lunch I went to the city FreshChoice supermarket. Picked up peanut butter, apples and a banana.
- In the afternoon I made bliss balls and took them home to share with Pete & Katja.
- I made vegan burrito enchildas for dinner [[ https://www.thegraciouswife.com/rice-and-black-bean-burritos-recipe/ ]]
  - vegan because we didn't have any cheese... I also used quinoa instead of rice and Pete added spinach.
  - It turned out better than I expected. Pete & Katja also liked it.
  - Also plenty of leftovers, so we have lunch tomorrow
  - I would make this again, but add cheddar cheese.
- Got a phone call from Anna this evening. She is trying to organize christmas gifts for the AKL gang. Her idea is that everyone should make a list of things they want to make it easier for everyone else to buy gifts. I'm not sure if I like this idea but I understand the reasoning. 
- I updated my system to use `pipx` to install python CLI tools. I also installed `vdirsyncer` but I need to finish setting it up.

A Curious Pattern Indeed
------------------------

I showed Pete this video from 3B1B [[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84hEmGHw3J8 ]].

We sat down and had a good think about the problem, drawing lots of diagrams and trying to find patterns in the number of segments.

After 25 minutes of thinking, we watched the solution, pausing often to discuss the various equations and try to guess what the next step is.

The Euler characteristic is really quite beautiful.

Pete's Game
-----------

Draw a 4x4 box.
Each player can choose how many squares they want to color in. They must color in at least one square. The squares must be contiguous and can only be on a single row or column.
The player to fill in the last square loses the game.
