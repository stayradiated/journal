====================

- Bought some new shaving soap from the Groom Room. It's "Taylor of Old Bond Street" brand - quite nice, I chose the Sandalwood scent.
- Grocery shopping at FreshChoice for Apples, Bananas, Peanut Butter, Peanuts and Raisins.
- Went for an afternoon barefoot run in the park. 5km at 4:30 pace.

Cypress
-------

Cypress tests are so slow!!! >17 minutes to run on CircleCI is too long. Alternatively, can I run all the cypress tests locally with certainty?

Why is the cypress failing? Are my insight calculations incorrect??
-> Hmm, total revenue within range seems to be using the wrong source data.
-> What is the calculation that Ruby is doing?

Prod issue
----------

Debugging error in prod. Customers cannot create people!
 
I couldn't reproduce the issue locally or on staging. It didn't seem to be related to a code change we had made recently. 

I could reproduce the issue on production but I didn't get any error messages. I didn't have access to the production server logs or database. I could see there was a new error from Rollbar on slack, but I didn't have permissions to view the details.

I tried using the REST API to create a user. This also failed AND returned a useful error message:

> Contract date range overlaps with another contract for this individual

This matched the Rollbar error we had been seeing in Slack. This error is thrown then a contract already exists with an overlapping date range. The question is, how is this possible for a newly created user that should only have one contract?!

I found a workaround that involved creating a user with a start date set to the year 2025 -- this would get around the validation check. The start date could then be changed afterwards.

Rowan came online and can check the database.
