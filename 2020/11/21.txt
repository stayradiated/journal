Sunsets can be beautiful, particularly the way clouds are lit up. It's interesting to note that the clouds appear differently depending on where you are standing. They may look dull grey and lifeless to you, but bright pink and colourful to someone else.

trash
-----

At 10am I joined ~50 other people on the roof of the carpark next to Saltworks. 

Kotte, Rory and Troy had organised a Salt district cleanup - where people pick up trash from the area. 

It was a cloudy day, warm with a slight breeze. Perfect, not too cold or hot. 

We started with a light yoga session, led by Kotte. Stretching arms, neck and thighs. 

We picked up gloves and plastic bags and got to work. I found a tonne of trash in car parks and empty lots. Over an 1.25 hours I filled 5 large bags. 

I jumped into the trailer to empty one of the bags so I could reuse it. Upon exiting the trailer I slammed my forehead into an unseen metal bar. It's left a bump but I think I'll be alright. 

At 12 noon everyone met outside Little High. Troy had the Bacon Bros truck setup and was cooking burgers for everyone. I had a jackfruit burger, they are quite delicious. I also grabbed two burgers for Pete and Brendo who were working upstairs in the office. 

I chatted to Kotte. She has been organising cleanup events for 3 years now! She said that she usually does them at the beach and has had as many as 150 people attend! This is the second event that she has donw with Bacon Bros. 

It's quite inspiring. I would like to do something similar. 

It reminded me of primary school. Misbehaving children would be punished by having to pick up litter. This seems like a good punishment but it implicitly trains people to associate picking up rubbish with bad behaviour - or inversely that good people don't pick up rubbish. 

Ideally I think we should have been rewarded if we were seen picking up trash and punished if we were caught littering. It should be seen as an honourable and selfless act to keep our environment clean. 

Of course, entropy always increases, and the trash we are picking up doesn't just disappear once we put it in the bin. It is a good idea to reduce our own waste by avoiding packaging when possible and reusing containers. 

Ground treasures:
