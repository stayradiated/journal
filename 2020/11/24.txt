===================

no trackpad
-----------

I disabled my trackpad. Going to see if I can go a whole day without using the mouse.

  xinput disable 'Synaptics TM3289-021'

I still have vhe trackpoint nipple as a fallback.

figma
-----

Allow using the <space> key moving the mouse to pan the screen:

  xinput set-prop 'Synaptics TM3289-021' 'libinput Disable While Typing Enabled' 0

todo
----

- [x] check that my microphone works
- [ ] write message for Tim/his family/new baby and send to Ruth
- [x] finish off PR #4951 (for real this time) (well nearly...)
- [ ] review/test ro's SAML PR
- [ ] continue learning how to configure/use Hasura
- [x] make bagels

alsamixer
---------

- easily check if microphone is working by using audacity
- use <space> to toggler microphone inputs
- input level doesn't need to be maxxed out

port numbers
------------

seems funny that a service gets to have their own port number.

Why can't I use port 0?

pomodoros
---------

I would like to try and achieve a pomodoro today.

How I hope it will work:

1. I set a task to complete
2. I set a timer for 25 minutes
3. I work undistracted for 25 minutes
4. I take a break for 5 minutes

While working in a pomodoro, avoid:

- checking slack
- talking to other people
- leaving your desk
- browsing the internet
- using your phone

This only works if I have a set task to complete.

pomodoros:

[1020,1045]: write unit tests for insight helpers
[1055,1120]: check that figures match for main branch

typescript
----------

Running the compiler in --watch mode is so much faster when fixing issues.

  npx tsc --noEmit --watch

stayradiated/shell
------------------

Need to figure out why bspwm/bspc loses it connection when I apt install something.

Alternatively find a way to fix the session.

bagels
------

It was Ivan's birthday on Saturday. I decided to make bagels for him. They will be ready to eat tomorrow!

sprouts
-------

I've been playing "sprouts" with Pete & Ivan.

It's an interesting game, I don't quite understand why someone wins or loses.

Pete discovered that once the graph equates to a triangle than the game is over.

samurai bowl
------------

Ivan invited me out for dinner. We asked Brendo if he wanted to join us but he had some important work he wanted to complete.

We walked over to Samurai Bowl for ramen. Ivan had bought a guitar off TradeMe and was carrying it with him.

Ivan's flatmate Mike joined us. I shouted Ivan dinner because it was his birthday recently.

I had the Vegan Spicy Miso Ramen with a Ramen Egg. It was delicious but very spicy, tears were shed.

blood test
----------

I think it would be worthwhile to get a blood test and see how my vitamin
levels are going. Kotte was telling me how she went vegan and become very deficient in vitamin b12 and now needs to get b12 shots every week.

cypress
-------

Make sure are running the same version of Cypress locally and on CI or else you waste a lot of time debugging errors.

In your CI script, you shoud use `npx cypress install` instead of `yarn add cypress`.

The latter will install the latest version of Cypress instead of the version you have specified in your package.json.
