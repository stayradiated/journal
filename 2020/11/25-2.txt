An indian restarant recommended by Ivan and Mike. Apparently the founder used to work for Paradise Indian in Auckland and started a competitng business across the road. 

I shouted Pete his dinner. 

I ordered the Charcoal Paneer with rice and a roti. Pete had the muglhai paneer, ivan had the muglhai with a meat and an okra dish. Mike ordered several dishes including sheep brains, sheep feet, biryani and chicken 65. I also ordered a veg 65 for the table. 

We feasted. The food was delicious, hot, spicy, full with flavour.
