intercity
---------

Just realised I had a bus booked for Sat 14 November to go to ashburton...

I completely forgot about this, I should have rescheduled it as credit...

morning
-------

Walking to the bus stop, soft drizzle of rain. 

Planning to catch the Orange line to Halswell shops and then switch to the 125 to get to the airport. The O. Bus was 8 minutes late and arrived just behind the 125! I had an extra half hour to kill so walked along the 125 route looking for a bus stop with a shelter (it was still drizzling). Waited under a pleasant tree on Lancewood Dr. 

Upon arriving at the airport I forgot to press the buzzer and nearly missed the airport stop. Fortunately the bus driver allowed me to get off while the bus was stopped at the gate. 

The Christchurch Airport has recently installed new security scanning equipment. They didn't ask to check my safety razor for blades (which I had already taken out and given to Katja). 

A very full plane, nearly didn't have room for my bag in the overhead lockers. 

Listening to the Off Menu podcast with Jo Brand while enjoying a cup of tea. Really want to eat the Cookie but I'm still doing the no-added-sugar thing. 

Books
-----

I should make a reading list file...

- Trainspotting (from Jo Brand @ Off Menu podcast)
- "The Emperor's New Mind" and "Gödel, Escher, Bach" (from Michael McGuffin)

Knots
-----

From DLL interview:

The carrick bend looks like a cool knot. I'd like to practice tying it with some rope. I bet it's a popular tattoo design as well. 

I haven't done any origami in years! Learning how to make different polygons would be fun. How would you fold a square into a pentagon?

It would be useful to catch TODO and FIXME comments with an ESLint.
I should check how the rest of the time feels.

Github pull request comments
----------------------------

Does software exist to view and reply to PR comments through the terminal?

I can't find anything decent. I could make something? I could also try using email to read & reply.

I should try out https://aerc-mail.org/

Stumbled upon Fltrdr. Looks like a cool project, I would like to try reading with it. [[ https://github.com/octobanana/fltrdr ]]

Ramen Stains
-------------

At Samurai Bowl (on Tuesday 24) I splashed ramen soup on my shirt and it left a stain. I tried soaking it in detergent but the grease mark is still visible. I will need to learn how to clean it.

todo: clean grease mark off grey shirt

Travel Bike
-----------

How practical would a portable folding bike be for travel?

Are they expensive?

Can you carry a bike on as carry-on luggage? I'm guessing not, which makes flying a bit tricker and more expensive. 

Could take a folding bike on a bus or train though. 

How durable are they? How comfortable? How fast can you go? The wheels would have to be smaller, right?

Seems like a clever way to get around.

Cycling to/from most airports would not be feasible. 

Cycling in the rain isn't fun. 

Even if the bike folds it would still be heavy to carry around. 

Tesla's Egg of Columbus
-----------------------

Jacob linked me to this.

This is a great painting:

- laundry strips
- chessable

Git
---

This is a great command for pretty printing all local branches along with info about the last commit in that branch.

I find this useful to keep track of which branches have been merged. I would normally use my `git-branch-cleanup` script but that doesn't work with the Runn repo because we squash commits.

The `| column` bit at the end is optional, but makes it much easier to read.

  alias gbl='git for-each-ref --color=always --sort=committerdate refs/heads/ --format=''%(HEAD) %(color:yellow)%(refname:short)|%(color:red)%(objectname:short)|%(color:reset)%(contents:subject)|%(color:blue)%(authorname)|%(color:green)%(committerdate:relative)%(color:reset)'' | column -t -s \|'

Pizza
-----

I shouted pizza for my mates in auckland. People are rather particular about
where they get their pizza, so we placed two orders from both Pizza Club and Sal's.

- pizza club: nicest chicken pizza
- pizza club: hawaiian pizza
- sals: sals nonna
- sals: sals meatball
- sals: 9x garlic knots

The Pizza Club website has a bug. I placed my order and paid for it, but which pizzas I ordered was not saved!
They called my phone number and I had to repeat my order. 

I messed up Chris's order. I accidentally ordered an extra vegetarian pizza instead of a Meatball. 

Chris and I picked up the Sals. Chris and Anna collected the Pizza Club.

We watched a few episodes of Friends season 1. They show has a few good jokes but I don't find it that appealing.
