morning
-------

Walking to the bus stop, soft drizzle of rain. 

Planning to catch the Orange line to Halswell shops and then switch to the 125 to get to the airport. The O. Bus was 8 minutes late and arrived just behind the 125! I had an extra half hour to kill so walked along the 125 route looking for a bus stop with a shelter (it was still drizzling). Waited under a pleasant tree on Lancewood Dr. 

Upon arriving at the airport I forgot to press the buzzer and nearly missed the airport stop. Fortunately the bus driver allowed me to get off while the bus was stopped at the gate. 

The Christchurch Airport has recently installed new security scanning equipment. They didn't ask to check my safety razor for blades (which I had already taken out and given to Katja). 

A very full plane, nearly didn't have room for my bag in the overhead lockers. 

Listening to the Off Menu podcast with Jo Brand while enjoying a cup of tea. Really want to eat the Cookie but I'm still doing the no-added-sugar thing. 

books
-----

I should make a reading list file...

- Trainspotting (from Jo Brand @ Off Menu podcast)
- "The Emperor's New Mind" and "Gödel, Escher, Bach" (from Michael McGuffin)

knots
-----

From DLL interview:

The carrick bend looks like a cool knot. I'd like to practice tying it with some rope. I bet it's a popular tattoo design as well. 

I haven't done any origami in years! Learning how to make different polygons would be fun. How would you fold a square into a pentagon?

It would be useful to catch TODO and FIXME comments with an ESLint.
I should check how the rest of the time feels.

github pull request comments
----------------------------

Does software exist to view and reply to PR comments through the terminal?

I should try out https://aerc-mail.org/

Stumbled upon Fltrdr. Looks like a cool project, I would like to try reading with it. [[ https://github.com/octobanana/fltrdr ]]
