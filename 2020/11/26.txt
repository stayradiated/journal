It would be useful to catch TODO and FIXME comments with an ESLint.
I should check how the rest of the time feels.
[[ https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-warning-comments ]]

Does software exist to view and reply to PR comments through the terminal?

I should try out https://aerc-mail.org/

Stumbled upon Fltrdr. Looks like a cool project, I would like to try reading with it. [[ https://github.com/octobanana/fltrdr ]]
