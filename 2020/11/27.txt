mish guru
---------

I have transferred ownership of the Sentinel project in Balena over to Jacob.

journal-utils
--------------

Rewrote my journal-utils in python. I learned how to parse arguments, format dates and  write files.

I have added some new aliases to my shell:

- jj: cd to journal directory
- jd: edit todays journal entry
- jw: edit this weeks journal entry

xournal++
---------

I'm trying out using Xournal++ to take handwritten notes.

It's great for drawings but it's a lot faster for me to type text than to write.

I wonder if I could easily embed drawings in these journal files? I think I would have to export them as SVG.

  xournalpp --create-img output.svg input.xopp

eslint: check import path exists
--------------------------------

I would like to create an ESLint rule that quickly checks that all CSS path imports exist.

I did it! [[ https://github.com/stayradiated/eslint-plugin-import-css-path ]].

It's a fork of [[ https://github.com/BohdanTkachenko/eslint-plugin-require-path-exists ]].

The main difference is that my plugin only checks CSS imports. The original plugin checks imports of all file types. 

It also has zero dependencies and uses `require.resolve` to check if the file exists -- so it's pretty quick!

shirt stains
------------

[[ https://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Grease-or-Oil-Stains-from-Clothing ]]

Trying this method to remove stains from my shirt.

1. Apply small amount of dish wash liquid to stain
2. Add a litle bit of water
3. Use toothbrush to gently scrub stain
4. Rinse with water
5. Wash in washing machine

weechat + wee-slack
-------------------

It's a great way to use slack from the terminal. Also makes it easier to, so I can chat with my mates in the #mish-guru channel.

I now have both Runn and Saltworks connected, so I can chat with my mates in the #mish-guru channel.

westfield mall
--------------

Walked barefoot into Newmarket. Streets are pretty clean.

Bought astra shaving razor blades. They also sold Layrite pomade so I bought a tub of the original.

Had a look in at the Icebreaker store. They had a 30% off sale. Tried on a few shirts but I didn't like how the sleeves sat. Picked up a black singlet for $48.

At 4pm I sat at the Something & Social cafe and caught up with Tim & Nicole for friday drinks. They are both away next week.
