Unparliamentary Language
------------------------

[[ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unparliamentary_language ]]

You can't say "git" in the UK parliament -- it's considered "Unparliamentary Language".

NZ has an official list, it's pretty funny: [[ https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/history-and-buildings/special-topics/unparliamentary-language/ ]]

- Idle vapourings of a mind diseased
- His brains could revolve inside a peanut shell for a thousand years without touching the sides
- Energy of a tired snail returning home from a funeral

Date Scones
-----------

I made a batch of cinnamon date scones for the flat before I left. They turned out pretty decent.

I made them because I had a whole pack of dates left over from my last visit - the dates weren't particularly nice to snack on, but were perfect for scones. 

This is the recipe I used:

Inner Link Bus
--------------

Caught the Inner Link bus, which does a loop around central Auckland. However seem to have caught the wrong bus because it's taking me the long way around. I'm rather confused - there must be 2 inner link buses that go in alternate directions but both start at the same bus stop.

Oh well. It's not a bad day for sitting on a bus. 

...

Bus unexpectedly terminated outside Victoria park and I had to walk from there. It was a nostalgic walk, following my old commute from when I worked at Lightbox. 

I arrived in the city to find that the Santa parade is on and most of the streets have been blocked off. That explains why the bus route have been a bit odd - they can't go along their usual paths. 


King of Cards
-------------

I stopped by the King of Cards boars game shop, perhaps the best board game shop in central Auckland. I was looking for the Crabs Adjust Humidity board game, but they were out of stock. They did have Chronicles of Crime ($77) and Betrayal in the House in the Hill ($84) but these games were too large to take with me. 

Other games I saw:

- Secret Hitler :: I've played the online version, it also wouldn't fit in my bag
- Came Up: Supercamel :: could be a good gift for Pete & Katja. Need to read the reviews

I purchased Poetry for Neanderthals - it looks similar to Articulate but you can only use one syllable words and there is an inflatable club to hit people when they mess up. 

How long can you use just one sound words to talk with? It is quite hard. There is a book by the XKCD guy that is made with just has the ten times ten times ten most used words - not quite the same but still fun to read.

Lunch
-----

I bought a falafel kebab from Ivan's Kebabs. $11.50. No where near Berlin quality but still filling enough. 

Kiwi Shuttle
------------

Waiting at the Queens Wharf to be picked up at 1:15pm. Large parts of Quay street are under construction so it's going to be a slow trip in and out of the city. 

Carol from Go Kiwi arrived at 1pm. She live in Whitianga,  is in her 70s and has been driving for over 50 years! She has no time for auckland drivers. 

Groceries
---------

After unpacking my gear I walked to the local supermarket. 

- [x] Capsicum
- [x] Cucumber
- [x] Broccoli
- [x] Apples
- [x] Dates
- [x] Pumpkin
- [x] Kumara
- [x] Carrots
- [x] Chickpeas
- [x] Hummus
- [x] Peppermint & Lemon tea
- [x] Iron Tablets
- [x] Cherry Tomatoes
- [x] Bananas

Total cost: $53

Should cover lunch/dinner for the rest of the week. 

Afternoon Run
-------------

I went out for a run along the beach. No shoes, just bare feet, soft sand and slow waves. It was glorious. 

I ran 5km and then went in for a quick swim. 

I aim to do this each morning. 

Dinner
------

Roast pumpkin, onion, chickpeas and broccoli + fresh carrots, cucumber, capsicum and tomato + scoop of hummus. 

Banana + apple + dates + peanut butter for desert. 

A very satisfying meal. I've been eating rubbish the last couple of days: pizza, subway, fried rice - it's great to have an early-ish dinner of veg and feel proper full.
