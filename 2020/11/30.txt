Surfing
-------

I've got Wednesday off work and the weather is looking great - I should see if I can book a surf lesson. A group lesson aimed at beginners would be suitable. 

Kayaking
--------

We should go kayaking on the weekend - everyone can hire a kayak and we can go explore Donut Island. $30pp.

I could also go by myself, but it would be more fun as a group activity. 

I'll see if anybody is keen.
