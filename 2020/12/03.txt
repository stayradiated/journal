dinner
------

It's 7am and I'm already thinking about dinner...

I think I will treat myself to a gourmet veggie patties and hamburger bun.
The hostel has a BBQ I can use. I have enough veg in the fridge to cover the other toppings.

- [ ] 2x veggie patties
- [ ] 2x burger buns

zsh
---

Today I learned about setting `REPORTTIME` in zsh. If set, zsh will automatically print how long a command took to execute -- but only if it was over the `REPORTTIME`.

Important note: this only tracks user+system time -- it doesn't actually detect on wall time.

For example:

  $ REPORTTIME=3
  $ sleep 2 
  $ sleep 4

Docs: [[ http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Parameters.html ]]

I want to understand the shell `time` builtin.

  $ time curl -s https://stackoverflow.com/ > /dev/null
  0.03s user 0.00s system 3% cpu 1.003 total

Notice how the entire requests takes 1s total, but barely any user/system time?

user:
  amount of time spent executing user code
  note that this is the sum time of all cores - so it may be higher for multi-threaded programs

system:
  amount of time spent executing kernel code
  i.e. system operations, context switching, resource allocation

This makes sense. Running `sleep 5` doesn't actually require the CPU to compute anything for 5 seconds. Same for requesting something over the network, most of the time is spent waiting for packets rather than calculating something in the CPU.
