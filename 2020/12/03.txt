It's 7am and I'm already thinking about dinner...

I think I will treat myself to a gourmet veggie patties and hamburger bun.
The hostel has a BBQ I can use. I have enough veg in the fridge to cover the other toppings.

- [ ] 2x veggie patties
- [ ] 2x burger buns

zsh
---

Today I learned about setting `REPORTTIME` in zsh. If set, zsh will automatically print how long a command took to execute -- but only if it was over the `REPORTTIME`.

Important note: this only tracks user+system time -- it doesn't actually detect on wall time.

For example:

  $ REPORTTIME=3
  $ sleep 2 
  $ sleep 4

Docs: [[ http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Parameters.html ]]

I want to understand the shell `time` builtin.

  $ time curl -s https://stackoverflow.com/ > /dev/null
  0.03s user 0.00s system 3% cpu 1.003 total

Notice how the entire requests takes 1s total, but barely any user/system time?

user:
  amount of time spent executing user code
  note that this is the sum time of all cores - so it may be higher for multi-threaded programs

system:
  amount of time spent executing kernel code
  i.e. system operations, context switching, resource allocation

This makes sense. Running `sleep 5` doesn't actually require the CPU to compute anything for 5 seconds. Same for requesting something over the network, most of the time is spent waiting for packets rather than calculating something in the CPU.

It's 8pm and I'm lying in the hammock at the hostel. It's a beautiful evening. I feel very full, I had a luxury meal.

After I left Little Latte cafe, I cycled over to New World. A driver passing by shouted out "Get a Helmet", which is sound advice - I just happen to be borrowing an old rusty bike that was left at the hostel and don't have access to a helmet. Cycling around beach towns does seem a lot safer than it probably is. Anyway, I picked up some chickpea masala patties, a packet of dates and a carton of eggs. I thought about getting some burger buns but they only come in large packs of 6 and wouldn't fit in my backpack. I decided to get a pack of roti instead - it looks a lot like a tortilla but it's thicker and you can fry it up. 

I cruised around town, thinking about what to do with my evening. I decided to drop off the groceries and then go for a run along the beach.

I ran 8.5km along the beach, doing a complete lap. I forgot to start strava until over halfway done though... I listened to Ten Fe and Penn's Sunday School. I stopped to rest my feet several times - running on sand is still a bjt sore, also considering that I've been out running every day for the past 5 days. I finished up with a quick dip in the waves to cool off. Sea water is saltier than I remembered.

Some girls had written "BE KIND" In large letters on the beach. Feeling nostalgic for the days of VHS rentals, I added in similar large letters, the word "REWIND". 

I considered using the BBQ, but the strong southerly was discouraging, so I cooked up dinner in the kitchen. Fried onions, chickpea patties, fried brocolli, fried eggs, capsicum, cucumber, roast kumara chips, hummus and fried roti bread. Very tasty. I have plenty of spare food for lunch or dinner tomorrow as well. 

For desert I had apple, dates and almond butter. At the New World a guy dressed up as Father Christmas handed me some chocolate, which I also ate. Two recent arrivals, an older couple, Christine and Jeff, also offered me some cheesecake and ice cream, which I readily accepted. I haven't had sweets in a month! So good!

After I finished washing up the dishes, I decided take the rusty bike for a ride to the Estuary. It was a pleasant evening but unfortunately that strong southerly breeze made it a bit too chilly to enjoy the view. I cycled back around and along the sandy beach. Cycling on sand is impossible unless you  an find the part of the beach where the sand is dry but compact enough to not sink in. Listening to music and enjoying the beach atmosphere. 

Sat by a bench by Beach Access point 8, tried taking a couple of selfies (not good at all). Came back to the hostel and lay in the hammock.
