Hostel
------

The internet has been quite rubbish since yesterday evening. I'm not sure if it is the hostel or my laptop.

Ok, after comparing fast.com results on my phone and laptop, it's probably my laptop...

Linux Security
--------------

By default, Arch Linux will lock your account for 10 minutes if you try to login 3 times and fail. This is rather annoying, but you can configure its rules by editing the file `/etc/security/faillock.conf`.

Surfing
-------

I have a surfing lesson booked for today. The original plan was to head out 9am but the waves aren't great so Mauro has rescheduled for 1pm. 

I decided to have an early light lunch at 11:30am - a banana and two apples. 

Mauro picked me up from the hostel and we drove over to the beach. There were some small waves but he didn't think it was doing a lesson. I decided to just go out surfing by myself instead - borrowing a board and wetsuit. I surfed for an 1 hour, practicing catching waves and paddling around. It was fun, but it would have been nice to have some bigger waves or have some friends around. 

I left the board at the rental trailer and walked back to the hostel to shower the sand off and get changed. 

Tmux
----

I wanted to know if there was a way to toggle a tmux pane -- similar to `PREFIX + z` but only for a single pane.

Someone else had exactly the same question: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145857/how-do-you-hide-a-tmux-pane

The suggested answer of using break-pane/join-pane works great:

  bind-key ! break-pane -d -n '...'
  bind-key @ join-pane -s $.1
  
  
 Lunch
 -----
 
 After surfing I had a proper lunch: a chickpea patty, fried egg, roti bread, sliced capsicum, cucumber, roast chickpeas and roast pumpkin. Healthy and delicious. I also treated myself to sliced apple, dates and almond butter - with a cup of peppermint/lemon tea on the side. 
 
I needed to catch up on work, so I ate with my laptop, catching up on slack messages. 

Privacy Policy
--------------

Did you know that New Zealand recently updated the Privacy Act? I didn't until I got any email from Pak'n'Save about it!

I'm not a lawyer, but from this overview it seems things are moving in the right direction:

[[ https://www.privacy.org.nz/tools/knowledge-base/view/535 ]]

> Strengthening cross-border protections: New Zealand agencies will have to take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information sent overseas is protected by acceptable privacy standards. 

What does it mean for information to be sent overseas? If it's on the public internet, it's available around the world! I guess if an NZ business stores customer information on a server located outside of NZ, then they need to make sure that data is secure?

Beachy Weekend
--------------

Hannah, Chris S and Anthonly picked me up from the NZ Surfnstay hostel. We drove over to Barrowclough road and unpacked our gear into Hannah's parents house. Anna and Chris G are going to arrive later on. 

I started prepping veggie skewers while the others headed over to New World to grab some more groceries. We are having zuchini, mushroom, capsicum and onion skewers which we will grill on the BBQ. Chris and Anthony helped to assemble them. I made a light salad: grated salad, cucumber, tomato and lettuce.
