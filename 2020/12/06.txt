Tide Times
----------

0541 low tide
0800 mid tide
1206 high tide
1511 mid tide
1816 low tide
0023 low tied

I wrote some short functions to make it easy to work with times

  // map 0:60 minutes to 0:100
  const m = (n) => (((n % 100) % 60) / 60) * 100
  const h = (n) => (Math.floor(n / 100) * 100)

  // convert time (format hhmm) to decimal
  const t = (n) => h(n) + m(n)

  // convert decimal back to hhmm
  const _ = (n) => h(n) + (((n % 100) / 100) * 60)

The t & _ functions convert time between hhmm and decimal.

For example,

12:00pm   t(1200) -> 1200
12:30pm   t(1230) -> 1250
12:59pm   t(1259) -> 1298.333

12:30pm + 1h = _(t(1230) + t(100)) => 1330

12:15pm + 2h55m = _(t(1215) + t(255)) => 1510

WARNING: do not prepend 0 to numbers in javascript or else they might be parsed as base 8. For example 0255 === 173

We can then use these functions to find midtide times by average low and high tide:

  const avg = (a, b) => _(((t(a) - t(b)) / 2) + t(b))

  avg(0541, 1206) // => 0759.5 (7:59 am)
  avg(1206, 1816) // => 1511 (3:11 pm)

It would be fun to have a language to make this easier to express:

  $ calc
  > 05:41 + 3h22m
  09:05

  > avg(05:41, 12:06)
  07:59:30

Kayak Afternoon
---------------

Hannah has a 2 person kayak we can borrow, but we need to get it 2k down the beach. Hannah, Chris and I walk it to the beach on a trolley and then paddle it across the bay. Tough work but faster than walking it. We have to navigate around the Surf Lifesaving competition which has a course set out in the water.

The others drive to Access Point 14 to meet us there. We hire 2x 2 person kayaks from Surfsup for $30/pp (total of $120). We can use the kayaks for 2 hours which gives up plenty of time to paddle across to Whenuakura island and have a swim on the beach next door.

After a quick lesson on how to paddle a kayak and what to do if you fall out, we set off. We've all got life jackets and have done a bit of kayaking before (except maybe Chris S?). The three kayak groups are: Chris G and Anna, Chris S and Hannah, and me and Anthony.

We cross over to Whenuakura island first. On the southern side of the island, There is a 12m high cave entrance with stunning rock formations. We paddle the kayaks through the narrow entrance. The island is nicknamed "Donut Island" because of it's shape. In the center is a beautiful lagoon of water surrounded by cliffs and trees. It's a magical spot, but also home to a wildlife sanctuary and the locals ask that we stay in the water and do not step on the land. There are a couple of other people in kayaks visiting as well.

Apparently there are tuatara that live on the island!
