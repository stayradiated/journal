Jo is flying to Antigua tomorrow. She is currently staying the night at an airport hotel in London. She says she might have wifi for a few days while in Antigua, but while she is on the boat we may have to converse over email -- which could be fun!

She is getting up for a 4am taxi tomorrow morning to catch her flight. I hope she doesn't catch COVID while travelling through all the airports.

travel

I decided to get all my travel down in one day and catch a bus back to Rotorua tonight instead of crashing on the couch and going back tomorrow. I'm feeling pretty knackered, I know I'm going to fall asleep on the bus. It will be nice to be back in my own bed. The goal is to do something with the family this weeekend.

On the 18th we are doing a mates Christmas
