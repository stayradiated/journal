What is a glass teletype? 
Oh, it's a computer terminal (think VT100).

git
---

Today I learned about `git clean`. 

This is useful for removing untracked files.

    # Print out the list of files and directories which will be removed (dry run)
    git clean -n -d

    # Delete the files from the repository
    git clean -f

There is even an interactive mode!
  
    git clean -i

weechat
-------

Opening long URLs in weechat is possible (I'm looking at you zoom!):

Use <M-l> to display chat in "raw" mode, then press <C-a u> to open the URL using tmux-urlview.

credit cards
------------

Thinking about how much entropy a credit card number has.

4916 9870 8718 3045

If every digit was random, than this would be ~53 bits of entropy.

    log2(10 ^ 16) ~= 53.2

However, every digit is _not_ random.

The first 6 digits are the bank identifier.

For example, a mastercard issued in NZ might start with "538643".

The last digit of the card is the checksum. You can use the Luhn Algorithm to restore any single missing digit of the card.

    16 - 6 - 1 = 9

    log2(10 ^ 9) ~= 29.9

Quite a reduction in the entropy.

However, we can do better. the last 4 digits of the card are often displayed on receipts. This leaves just 6 digits unknown. We can guess 5 of these digits and calculate the 6th using the checksum.

    16 - 6 - 4 - 1 = 5

    log2(10 ^ 5) ~= 16.6

This is just the numbers 0 - 99,999.
