===================

It's December!

monthly goals
-------------

I made it a month without added sugar, alcohol or meat. 

Added sugar: I cheated a little by eating out at restaurants -- I'm sure they add sugar to their food -- but because it's not printed anywhere I let it go. I also ate that one cookie I got on the plane...

Alcohol: Had a couple small glasses of Pete's home made cider, also had that one drink out at Little High when James was in Christchurch. Didn't miss alcohol, I'd rather have a cup of tea and a glass of water.

Meat: 100% no cheating, it's pretty easy to not eat meat. Going 100% plant based (i.e. no animal products) should be a challenge for another month.

Goals for December:

- No peanut butter (this is going to be difficult)

I ate way too much peanut butter in November, I think I should take a break. I am not sure if there is a decent alternative -- I could just eat dates and apples plain... What about almond butter? It's twice the cost, which would encourage me to eat less of it - and I've heard almonds are more nutritious than peanuts.

the mo

How long will it last? I should probably shave it off. Need to get a decent profile photo with it first...

surfing
-------

I have a surfing lesson booked for 10:00 today, however it's been rescheduled to 11:30 (something to do with the tide being too high). 

I have also paid for a second private lesson, which will probably be on Friday (either 8:30am or 1pm).
