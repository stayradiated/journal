email
-----

I have decided to finally move away from hosting my mail with Google.

It's taken a while, because Google Mail works really well and I've got two accounts hosted for free (grandfathered plan).

I've switched czabania.com to use Zoho, because I need hosting for 4 users and it's pretty cheap (~$85 a year).

I'm currently using stayradiated.com with FastMail, on the trial -- not sure if I'll stick with FastMail or not.
