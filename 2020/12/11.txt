google photos
-------------

I'm looking at moving away from Google Photos.

Currently exporting an archive of everything using Google Takeout.

I'm curious how much data I have stored in this service.

PhotoStructure looks like a decent self-hosted option: https://photostructure.com

email

I've been trying out using Aerc as an email client. It's pretty friendly to get set up.

NZ Covid Tracer
---------------

Has recently been updated with bluetooth tracking. The source code has also been published on Github, though they say they are not accepting issues or pull-requests at the moment.
