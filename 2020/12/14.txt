Yesterday I tried recording a journal entry using my voice. The idea was sound
but I ended up talking for over fifty minutes!

I am rather disappointed with the available offline speech to text
transcription software -- I thought this was a solved problem.

There is the Google Speech API, but this isn't free and the `gcloud ml speech`
client only seems to work with tiny files. There are also plenty of online
services that want to charge $5 an hour for audio transcription.

The transcription software I ended up using is Picovoice. It's free for
personal use. They have multiple engines, each with a different purpose and all
named after animals. I am using the "leopard" engine.

Leopard does a pretty good job of taking a large audio file and converting the
whole thing to text. It's also very quick and accurate enough to be useful.

It requires that the audio be a single mono WAV track, sampled at 16,000 Hz.
This is easy enough to do with Audacity and could be easily automated with a script.

Leopard's translation is far from perfect however, often misunderstanding what
I am saying.  It also does not understand punctuation, pauses or capitalization
- it just outputs a stream of uppercase words.

This means that fifty minutes of rambling audio can take another fifty minutes
of editing to get it into a useable state.

Future recordings are going to have to change. One thing I am trying today is
to use dictation operators.

For example, when I end a sentence I say "stop" (just like a telegram!). I can
then easily replace "stop" with a period and a new line.

I will also need to be more thoughtful about what I am saying, and to enunciate
my words clearly to avoid transcription errors. I can also have longer pauses
between sentences (because time doesn't matter) so I have plenty of time to
think.
