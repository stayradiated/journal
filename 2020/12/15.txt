Todo
----

At 2 pm I have a virtual coffee scheduled with Pete. I'm looking forward to it.

I still have not heard from the bike repair shop about my wheel. If I haven't
heard anything by this afternoon then I will check in after my haircut at 3:30
pm.

I think this morning I will go for a bike ride -- oh no I can't because I don't
have a bike!

I would like to visit the supermarket and pick up some snacks (I'm thinking
apples, dates, almond butter, etc). I would also like to grab some chocolates
for Chris and Anna, to add to their present. 

Haskell
-------

Yesterday I started learning Haskell  (the programming language). It's a lot
better than I expected! I spent a lot of time reading
http://learnyouahaskell.com -  Which is an excellent resource. I haven't made a
WebServer yet, but I have done some research into different libraries to use. I
think I will try and use Warp, which is used by Hasura and also claims to be
one of the fastest WebServer libraries for haskell.
