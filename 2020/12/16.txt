=====================

Todo:

- [ ] Wash shorts and singlets for trip to Auckland tomorrow
- [ ] Go out to dinner at Eat Street with family this evening￼
- [x] Work from a cafe this morning, perhaps AVC? -> Grøunded
- [ ] alternatively try and go for a morning walk to the local cafe with mum --
      we would have to be back by 10am for the dev meeting￼
- [ ] get watch battery changed at Time Central

I still haven't picked out any gifts for my family. I'm not sure what to get
them, I should probably have a think about that today.

I could help mum set up a website for the business on SquareSpace, using a
pre-built template. I think that would be the best way to get them a website,
or perhaps another service?￼￼￼

I'd love to go out to the beach for a week with the family next year, I could
look at organizing/￼booking that as a present. 

I've been thinking about getting a few buckets of chocolate's to fill up the
Chuffed gift for Chris and Anna. But they might melt on the way up to Auckland
tomorrow, so I think it might be a better idea to purchase the candy in
Auckland tomorrow evening.

grøunded
--------

The spicy ginger latte is _not_ recommended.

The cacao latte was much better.

docker-compose
--------------

Try and remember that `--net=host` is set using `network_mode: host`.

offline
-------

It would be nice to be able to run Hasura offline. I think I just need to
disable telemetry.

droidcam audio
--------------

Use a single mono channel at 16000 Hz.

» ./droidcam-cli -a ios 4747
» arecord -D hw:1,1,0 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 16000 test.wav

Should work in audacity as well.

Doesn't sound very good though :(
