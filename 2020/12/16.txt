Todo:

- [ ] Wash shorts and singlets for trip to Auckland tomorrow
- [ ] ￼Go out to dinner at Eat Street with family this evening￼
- [ ] Work from a cafe this morning, perhaps AVC?
- [ ] alternatively try and go for a morning walk to the local cafe with mum -- we would have to be back by 10am for the dev meeting￼

I still haven't picked out any gifts for my family. I'm not sure what to get them, I should probably have a think about that today.

I could help mum set up a website for the business on SquareSpace, using a pre-built template. I think that would be the best way to get them a website, or perhaps another service?￼￼￼

I'd love to go out to the beach for a week with the family next year, I could look at organizing/￼booking that as a present. 

I've been thinking about getting a few buckets of chocolate's to fill up the Chuffedtgift for Chris and Anna. But they might melt on the way up to Auckland tomorrow, so I think it might be a better idea to purchase the candy in Auckland tomorrow evening.
