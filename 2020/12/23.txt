=====================

Sleeping in til 8ish this morning...
I need to force myself to get up at 5:45am again.

Out for a morning run between 8 and 9.
Covered 9km at 4:03 m/km pace -- not too bad.
Running shoes make city running so much better!
I feel that barefoot running encourages better practices though -- toe first, running on grass.

Grocery shopping at PAK'nSAVE.
Dad repaired mum's bike (the runner bean) and I took it for a test drive.
No issues with the chain slipping off.

Shopping list:

- a whole pumpkin!
- several mariri red apples
- glorious butternut hummus
- heavenly almond butter
- two heads of broccoli
- three zucchini
- three onions
- cherry tomatoes
- baby kale

Total: $40.87

Dinner
------

Dad was keen to go out for dinner to celebrate the end of the work year for
Total Carpet Services.

I suggested we try Arisu (Korean BBQ). Everyone was surprisingly on board with 
the idea. We arrived there around 7pm. The host was very kind and helped us
pick out several dishes (#6, #37 & #38).

We enjoyed Beef Bulgogi, Yang-Nyeom Chicken and a Dumpling stew. There also
plenty of tasty side dishes to try. I ordered a Korean Sake for the table, but
our family doesn't drink much so I ended up taking the bottom home.

Everyone enjoyed the food and we left feeling very full. I would love to return
-- there are some many other options on the menu to try!
