=====================

Sleeping in til 8ish this morning...
I need to force myself to get up at 5:45am again.

Out for a morning run between 8 and 9.
Covered 9km at 4:03 m/km pace -- not too bad.
Running shoes make city running so much better!
I feel that barefoot running encourages better practices though -- toe first, running on grass.

Grocery shopping at PAK'nSAVE.
Dad repaired mum's bike (the runner bean) and I took it for a test drive.
No issues with the chain slipping off.

Shopping list:

- a whole pumpkin!
- several mariri red apples
- glorious butternut hummus
- heavenly almond butter
- two heads of broccoli
- three zucchini
- three onions
- cherry tomatoes
- baby kale

Total: $40.87
