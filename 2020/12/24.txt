walking
-------

Convinced mum to go for a walk around the block. I was hoping to stop by
Grøunded cafe for a hot drink, but they were closing up by the time we go
there.

Mum enjoyed the walk and it was good chatting together.

Going to aim to get 2 walks next week.

dinner
-----

James and I cooked a satay stir fry.

- 3 cloves of garlic
- 3 small sliced onion
- 2 carrots, cut into match sticks
- handful of button mushrooms, sliced
- 1 chicken breast, diced
- 2 small red capsicum, sliced
- ¼ head of broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 can of coconut cream
- a large dollop of peanut butter
- a decent helping of sweet chilly sauce
- ½ a bag of canton noodles

Turned out pretty well.

Chris and Anthony turned up just as we started eating. They had just traveled
down from Auckland. I had asked Chris to deliver me the Telestrations game,
which he did.

I was hoping to play it with the family tonight, but Dad was on the phone,
James was in his room on his phone and mum was cooking/cleaning.

I went for a walk to get some air.

I'm not a big fan of Christmas, but it would be nice to have some fun together
as a family.

It's difficult to not take people you live with for granted.

jo

Jo sent me another message this afternoon :)

The Pelican has just arrived in Curacao, but everyone is stuck on board because
the authoriities are concerned about covid.

I get to open her present tomorrow.

watches
-------

I'd buy the classic casio digital watch if I didn't already have a watch.

vim

vim-abolish is such a great vim plugin.

    :%s/Accounts/Contracts

cuisines
--------

I'd like to do another family foreign food day. I plan to go through this last,
write down 10 cuisines and put them in a hat for dad to pick out.

spotlight
---------

I bought three cushion covers from Spotlight.

I've stuffed them with the cushion fillings I originally bought for Jo.

I was thinking about wrapping them, but it seems like an excessive use of
wrapping paper.

time central
------------

My Nokia watch started acting funny this morning. Bluetooth was still working
and the minute hard was pointing to the right time -- but the hour hand was
off.

The app had been warning me to get the battery replaced, so I finally did.

I visited Time Central, were the guy replaced the battery in 10 minutes and
charged $25.

I also picked up a SR621SW battery for my DW watch.
