[Christmas Day]

- Waking up at 6am to a message from Jo :) She is currently in Curaçao.
- Waiting for everyone else in the family to wake up. Jo suggests I rush in to
  James' room and shout "It's Christmas!".
- Mum bought chocolate waffles for breakfast. I prepared bacon and eggs to go
  with them. I set up the table/chairs in the middle of the lawn so we could
  eat in the morning sun. Eventually everyone gets out of bed and we have a
  pleasant breakfast.
- We exchange gifts:
  * James receives very bright USB rechargeable bike lights
  * Dad receives a fishing multi-tool
  * I gift everyone a cushion
  * I receive a miniature roulette table and a Monty Python book
  * "Santa" also gifted everyone these neat books with hidden compartments that
    were filled with mixed nuts.
- Mum prepared a large Christmas lunch:
  * Hors D'ouevre: baked baguette with whipped feta cheese, rocket and
    marinated tomatoes
  * Main: Roast Turkey with all the trimmings
  * Sides: Filo Salmon pie + thinly slice roast potato + mango avo salad
  * Sweets: chocolate brownie topped with pistachio and sprinkles of candy cane
- After lunch I introduced the family to Telestrations and we played several
  rounds. It went all right, but I think it will be better next time now that
  everyone understands the game.
- James and I assembled the LEGO Technic Catamaran (#42074). James did most of
  the work, it turned out really well. We watched a YouTube video about a life
  size Bugatti Chiron LEGO car.
- I opened up Jo's present - it's a cork globe of the Earth! It comes with
  several red pins so you can mark out your favourite spots. I've put pins in
  for Rotorua, Berlin, Devon and one for Jo in Curaçao. I sent Jo a photo and a
  note saying thanks :)
- I went out for an afternoon run around Arawa park. I cycled there and ran
  several laps kicking the soccer ball. Also didn't wear a top -- trying to
  even out my single tan.
- Around 5pm Dad kindly drove James and I out to the Blue Lake. It wasn't too
  busy and I had a lovely swim in the water. We threw the volleyball around for
  a bit and then went for a short walk in the forest. On the way back we
  stopped to checkout the new Forestry Hub carpark -- I noticed that Grøunded
  have a little stall out there.
- For dinner we had leftovers from lunch, still delicious. James and I opened
  the rest of the presents:
  * I received a New Zealand tourism travel guide and a pack of chocolate almonds
  * James received a tin of biscuits and a tobleron
  * Dad received a box of turkish delights
  * Mum also bought out a Dyson Hot+Cold bladeless fan (as a gift for the family)
- I put on the classic film "Heaven Can Wait" (1943) -- filled with witty
  dialog, it's a joy to watch. I was going to put on the more Christmassy "The
  Shop Around The Corner" (1940), but we had watched it recently so I chose
  another of Ernst Lubitsch's films.
- Mum served us strawberry trifle for dessert - we are so spoiled.

I'd like to find my old book on knots.
