Monday 28 Dec 2020
==================

- Chris and Anna are heading back to Auckland today.  I should see if Anthony
  and Chris want to catch up. The plan is to grab a lift with them back to
  Auckland on the 30th/31st.
  
- Working on mishguru this morning in bed. Finished the refactor of mediatools,
  now I just have to get receiveSnap tests passing. Update: all the receiveSnap
  tests are passing! Tomorrow I can start updating the API calls in SnapTurbo.

- Morning walk around the block with a cup of tea.

- Chris Smith is in driving into town this evening, he might be free tomorrow.
  Chris & Anna are back in Auckland with the boat! Hannah is in Whangamata. I
  think Anthony is around Rotorua but I haven't heard from him.

- Roast Veg salad for lunch (pumpkin, onion, carrot, brocolli, kale, miso
  paste, hummus)

- Kicking a soccer ball around in the back yard, practicing how many times I
  can kick it without it touching the ground (hacky-sack?)

- Ate far too many shortbread biscuits (they are soo good though!)

- Still practicing the La Bamba riff on guitar. I've got the timing sorted now,
  just need to get good. Also could try to learn the harmonics that Justin
  suggests.

- James and I went out for a bike ride around the Redwoods (James' suggestion).
  We followed the Mokopuna track from the info center out to Tarawera road.
  I filmed us riding around and cut it down to 10 seconds and posted it to
  YouTube.

- Mum and I drove down to the Warehouse. I was looking to purchase a 100L of
  bean bag beans, but they had sold out over Christmas. Mum purchased several
  plastic food containers and a box of Turkish Delights. I bought 3x small
  plastic Sistema containers I might be able to use when travelling. 

- After dinner I brought out Exploding Kittens and explained to everyone how to
  play. James started the game and THE VERY FIRST CARD was an EXPLODING KITTEN!
  James defused and of course put the kitten back on top for mum to pick up.
  Mum did the same thing to me… I put it back in the middle of the pile so we
  actually had a chance at playing a game, but was soon knocked out a few
  rounds latest, leaving just mum & dad to finish the game. We all enjoyed the
  game, I'm not sure if there was something in the Stollen we were having for
  dessert, but Mum was hilarious and there was a lot of laughter. We made it
  all the way to the final 3 cards before Dad accidentally blew himself up and
  Mum won the game! Definitely worth playing again.

- We watched the first half of Sherlock Holmes (2009). Still one of my
  favourite movies.

Todo
----

- [x] Read through the NZ Tourism guide and get ideas about where to travel in
  January

- [ ] I should see if I can get a dentist appointment while I am in Auckland? it's
  been a while since my last checkup

- [x] I would like to introduce the family to a new board game, perhaps Exploding
  Kittens?

Travel
------

- I would you like to take James on a week long trip in January. I'm not sure
  where… Wellington is quite a cool city that I know pretty well maybe James
  and I can go down there for a bit?

- I would like to get back to Christchurch for a week at some point in January
  as well

- I would like to go on a full family trip to the beach but that's probably not
  going to happen until mid February.

- I have become aware that the more time I spend travelling the less time I
  have to work on my own projects. I need to find a way of balancing the two.

Exercise
--------

Exercising in the back yard before lunch with 15kg slam ball:

- push ups
- squats with ball
- sit ups (regular & frog leg)
- slams
- russian twists with ball
- plank w/ knees to elbows
- leg raises
- carry ball above head
- burpees

Trying to develop my core, the leg raises were the worst! I should practice
those each day.


Dinner 
------

I cooked an Chicken Korma curry for dinner

Heat a frying pan with a bit of oil and fry the following:

- 3 cloves of garlic (crushed)
- 2 onions (sliced)
- 1 carrot (sliced)
- 1 packet of Korma paste
- 2 chicken breasts (diced)
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 1 yellow capiscum
- 1 can of coconut milk
- a dash of hot sauce
- 1 Tbsp of tomato puree
- ½ packet of canton noodles
- flaked almonds (for presentation)

Served with basmati rice, very tasty, very good. Everybody loved it.
