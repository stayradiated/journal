==================

- Chris and Anna are heading back to Auckland today.  I should see if Anthony
  and Chris want to catch up. The plan is to grab a lift with them back to
  Auckland on the 30th/31st.
  
- working on mishguru this morning in bed. Finished the refactor of mediatools, now I just have to get receivesnap tests passing.

- Read through the NZ Tourism guide and get ideas about where to travel in January

- I would you like to take James on a week long trip in January. I'm not sure whereâ€¦ Wellington is quite a cool city that I know pretty well maybe James and I can go down there for a bit?

- I would like to get back to Christchurch for a week at some point in January as well

- I would like to go on a full family trip to the beach but that's probably not going to happen until mid February.

- I should see if I can get a dentist appointment while I am in Auckland? it's been a while since my last checkup

- I would like to introduce the family to a new board game, perhaps Exploding Kittens?

- I have become aware that the more time I spend travelling the less time I have to work on my own projects. I need to find a way of balancing the two.
