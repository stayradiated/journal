10s summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-YnvbjeZV8V

Morning Run
-----------

Morning 10K run along the 2020 Rotorua Marathon 10K track (starting at Energy
Events Centre, through to Redwood Forest, up Nursery Rd Hill and back again).

Average pace: 4:15 Min/Km.

Listening to the Dan Carlin's "Celtic Holocaust" and some music on shuffle.

Benson the Hedgehog
-------------------

We found a hedgehog in our front yard. I've named him Benson. We built a
little hut to provide some shade for him, but when we came back in the
afternoon he had left.

Lake Trip
---------

Afternoon picnic at the lake. Aimed to leave at 13:00, in the car and ready to
go at 13:45. Mum & Dad prepared ham & mustard rolls, I made sure we had a
Thermos of hot water to make tea and James brought along a bottle of lemon
cordial.

I wanted to go to Lake Okareka, but it was too busy for Mum & Dad so we found a
spot at Lake Tikitapu instead. Due to the extra clouds and a stiff lake breeze,
it was a lot colder at the lake than I had expected. We lay on our picnic
blanket on the grass and sat huddled with cups of tea, eating our ham rolls. We
also brought along bits of leftover christmas cakes, which was a nice treat.
Mum accidentally ate the last of the Stollen and while eating it asked me if I
enjoyed it! (I didn't get to have any that day). After half an hour we were
back in the car on our way to sunny Rotorua.

Driving Range
-------------

I met up with Chris Smith in the afternoon. I suggested we visit the local
Driving Range and hit a bucket of balls.

Cost:

- $17 for 90 balls
- $2 for hire of a fairway wood

Dinner
------

Mum & James prepared the following:

- Cajun spiced chicken
- Summer mango salad
- Beetroot (from can)
- Asparagus (from can)
- Roast veggies (leftovers)

James whipped up a bowl of cream and applied it to the Pavlova, topping it
with blueberries and strawberries. Delicious!

I set the table outside and soldered a cable back together that Mum had snipped
in half while gardening.

We sat in the lounge room and watched the second half of Sherlock Holmes (2009).
