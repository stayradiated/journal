- Grocery shopping at PAK'nSAVE:
  * 6x corn
  * 1x dried dates
  * 7x mariri red apples
  * 1x pack of fresh asparagus
  * 1x pack of Turkish bread
  * 1x pack of nuts and raisins

- Exercising in the yard with slam ball. No shirt and lots of sunblock. Getting
  better at leg raises, sit ups, feeling the burn when doing squats.

- Mum has had a stressful morning. She has been trying to purchase new tyres
  for the Ipsum, but all the places she visited were rather busy and the one
  quote she did get were for tyres that received very negative reviews online.
  She returned in the afternoon to Beaurepaires and got a decent quote for a
  new pair of Dunlop's she is quite happy with.

- Organising a big lunch for the family. Grilling corn on the BBQ along with
  balsamic aspargrus. We ate turkish rolls with sliced ham, garden salad and
  cheese. Everyone enjoyed the food.

- Travelling to Auckland with Chris and Anthony. Exactly 3 hours. Left at 5pm
  arrived at 8pm. I shouted fuel for the trip and a pack of Mars Pods for some
  #creamyandcrunchy sugary goodness.

- Grabbing a kebab for dinner with Chris S. We walked to the Epsom Turkish
  Kebab place. I had a falafel kebab with hummus, garlic yoghurt and mild
  chilli sauce. Delicious! Also purchased a baklava because they are quite
  sweet, taste pretty good but rather dry -- I bet they are best eaten right
  after they make them. The kebab place is shutting down for a few days, if I'm
  still in Auckland when they reopen, that would be the best time to try the
  baklava again. Could also try making it myself?

- Jo and the Pelican are sailing steadily along the north cost of South America
  and will soon arrive in Costa Rica.

- Still reading "Permutation City" by Greg Egan. Interesting concepts about a
  Copy trying to prove that it's living in the real world by using a
  "Garden-of-Eden" state.
