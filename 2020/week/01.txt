Weak Notes #1
=============

- Woo! First week of 2020! This is a slightly shorter week than usual, 'cos it
  starts on a Wednesday. Shout out to Odin!
- I spent New Years with my friends on a mountain in Auckland. We sat at the
  summit of Big King watching the Sky Tower fireworks and enjoying a shot of
  whisky.
- The Australian bush fires are absolutely mental. The amount of carnage and
  lives lost to it is unreal. On Sunday, as I sit in Auckland writing this, the
  sky is a hazy orange at 2:30pm from all the smoke! Everything has an odd aura
  to it. Donated to the Australian Rural Fire Service - those people are
  heroes. (https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/volunteer/support-your-local-brigade)
- This week I have continued to experiment with recording and editing short
  films, mostly of my friends and our New Years celebrations. I have been using
  olevi-editor, which I am quite hapy with. MY videos are all on YouTube, but
  not all public. I also tried filming in portrai to create a short vertical
  video which I can publish to my Snapchat story.
- I want to keep recording and editing videos this year. Previous years I have
  done polaroid and digital photos. I think 2020 is video. I want to get better
  at audio recording and speaking/narrating to the camera.
- I have some ideas about starting a routine, which includes German practice,
  guitar lessons, running and exercising with James. 
- My friend, Edin, has a book out - "The Brilliance of Birds" and it is
  flipping amazing. I have been learning all about NZ birds, I also kind of
  want to publish a book, but I have no idea about what. Maybe I will finally
  get some travel photos printed.
- Going to try eating an environmentally sustainable diet, not sure exactly
  what this is, but starting with no meat on the weekends + friday.
