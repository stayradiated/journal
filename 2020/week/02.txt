Week 2
======

Montag 6th
----------

- Travelling back to Rotorua by bus (10am - 2.10pm). Sitting next to a girl who
  is carrying a small pot plant - an unexpected Christmas gift.
- James and I took the mountain bikes to the park at the end of the Devon
  Street for an hour. He really enjoyed whizzing around. It was insanely windy,
  but we didn't back down and got a couple of laps in.
- Had a great evenig cooking BBQ grilled corn - super easy but delicious with a
  garlic herb butter. Also used up a bunch of old bananas in a banana bread -
  turned out moist and scrumptious.

Dienstag 7th
------------

+ Grreat lie in bed til 9:30am! Had a gorgeous shave with a hot towel. Face
  feels super smooth.
- Parents are looking at buying a new car.

Mittwoch 8th
------------

- Morning run, legs are a bit sore.
- Big mountain bike ride around town with James. Ward ave, to Te Ngae bridge to
  PAK'nSAVE and back home. Tried to get something to eat from Guidoughs but
  they are on holiday.

Donnerstag 9th
--------------

- Morning run - 7.7km with under 4 min/km pace!
- Success! James and I cycled to zippy's cafe for lunch. We shared two bagels.
  A PHAT and a Jam. Not bad.
- Watching the Good Oments TV show. Mom reallly likes David Tennant.
- Spent most of my morning refactoring my dotfiles to use git-crypt.

Freitag 10th
------------

- Got the new event system working for Bansky. It's not perfect, but good
  enough to build upon.
- [x] Goal: go to redwrodos with James → Success! We cycled all the way there,
  which involved going across the Hemo Gorge track. We completed the "kids
  loop" - which is a lot more challenging than it sounds, and celebrated with
  an ice coffee at the Bike Cafe. Jame is surprisingly good at cycling. His
  bell fell off this bike though...

Samstag 11th
------------

- James and I cycled to the kuirau markets. I bought dumplings (delicious). We
  visited the Warehouse and I bought James a new bell and handlegbar grips. We
  sat in the shade at the lakefront while I at my ice cream. THere was a cute
  girl sitting on the bench next to use with her eyes shut.
- Finished watching Good Omens - 7/10.

Sonntag 12th
------------

- Had a late start. Shaving after a hot towel is definitely the way to go, much
  smoother skin. Headed to Grøunded for my regular weekly reflection. Had a
  good catch up with Jo.
- We should certainly go for a swim at the blue lake this afternoon.
