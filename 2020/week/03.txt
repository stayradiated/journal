Montag 13

Dienstag 14
-----------

- [x] Haircut at wilsons - 2pm (with James). We cycled there, waited about half an hour. James bumped into an old school mate there; Nicholas.
- [ ] Go for a swim at the aquatic centre... did not happen.
- [x] Pavlova for tomorrow night. It looks amazing!

Mittwoch 15
-----------

- BBQ Dinner with Sarah & her mum
- Lots of baking: made a bavarian plum sheet cake: turns out removing the plum
  stone is not a quick or easy process. I also whipped up a lot of cream and
  slathered it on the pavlova. Mum brought out a bag of nectarines, so I sliced
  them up and decorated the pav with them.
- Had a catch-up phone call with Jacob. Discussing

Donnerstag 16
-------------

- James and I went mountain biking together in the forest. James is getting
  more confident on the bike, so I let him ride in front. He also surprised me
  by doing several chin-ups on the exercise bars.
- We have had the tent in the backward for a few days now, but only did something with it today.
- Went to Bay Audiology for a hearing check. I have normal hearing. I want Dad
  & Mum to go for a check.

Freitag 17
----------

- Caught bus to Auckland (10:45 - 14:45). Working  on plextools algo for
  finding matching tracks based on track metadata.
- Anna picks me up from Panmure station. We purchase some old rusty tools from
  Junk & Disorderly and a few plants from Kings Plant Barn. Anna soaks the
  tools in a bucket of acid and I try using a weedeater (whipper snipper) for
  the first time... Every 2 minutes I would have to pause & rethread the
  plastic cable.
- We had burgerfuel for dinner and then played a game of hearts, with Anna
  having a surprise victory. With plenty of sweets to keep us going we played
  one night ultimate werewolf until 1am - lots of fun, confusion and lies. We
  should get more people to join us for a future game.

Samstag 18
----------

- Goodall & Anna had an early start (to Anna's distress) with a morning walk up
  Mt. Eden. I went for a run to Monte Cecilia and continued my bootcamp.
- I continued to work on plextools and then we all headed to the fed. I
  ordered the best ugly salmon bagel and paid with Apple pay.
- We all helped out in the garden. The guys are moving out soon and it needed
  weeding and tidying up all the leaves. It was very hot outside.
- We had pizza for dinner and then embarked on a game of a Risk.

Sonntag 19
----------

- Morning bootcamp in park near guys flat. Focusing on upper body. There was a
  group of guys practicing baseball again.
- Headed to a nearby cafe - "Just Like Martha" - for my morning reflection.

  no-one was eliminated.

Focus
-----

I accidentally wiped my beets music library DB, so I had to rebuild it. This
caused a lot of items to be retagged and Plex needed to be cleaned up: Fixing
missing items in playlists, removing duplicate albums and preserving track
ratings. I used my plextools until to help make this process easier.

Rules for Speedier Risk
-----------------------

- Attacker announces the total number of armies invading a territory
- Resolve the first battle round with dice and apply the results
- Pair off all remaining armies defending with all remaining armies attacking
  and remove pairs
- The side with armies remaining controls the territory. Defender wins a tie
  (leaving 1 army to defend).

Ideas for other risk variations:

- CAPITALS: Each continent is assigned a random capital city. Conquering the
  capital converts all the defending players armies on that continent to your
  team.
- LESS RISK CARDS: Start out with obtaining a risk card each round you conquer
  a territory, but each time a player cashes in their stars, raise the amount
  of territories. Required to get a card.
