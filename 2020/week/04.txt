- 10:00 Bus from Auckland to Rotorua. Bus was slightly delayed and had a 30min
  pause in Hamilton. The Ma Higgins cookie from the supermarket is better value
  than Cookie Time.

  Guidough's Bakery and picked up a coffee/caramel slice (for the family).
- Had a nap in the afternoon
- Went out for an evening ride to sulphur point, listening to Zach Winters, texting Jo.

- Big cleanup day! Going through all the gear in the back shed, taking all the
  gear out of the shed, placing it in the yard. Mum & Dad helped decide what to
  keep/sell/trash. Washed and cleaned up a few items and taken a photo of items
  for Trade Me.
- Morning phone call with Jo, she hsa been bouldering and is heading to a
  conference in South Hampton on Friday.

  Indian Star.

  another ride, this time to PAK'nSAVe (for a bueno) and then to Sulphur Point
  and bake home via the BMX Track.
