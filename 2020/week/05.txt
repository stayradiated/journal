Week #5
=======

Montag 27
---------

- Started the day with a morning run. Cycled to Puarenga Park and ran 5km
  non-stop. Need to get better at running quickly without pausing.
- Helped Dad clear out the garage - took photos of water skis, Kneeboard,
  Johnson 25 HP outboard and old waders.
- Got mum on her bike and cycled down High St. Mum hit the front brakes and
  bruised her knee!

- Work up with an odd sore throat.

Dienstag 28
-----------

- My slam ball arrived today! It's a 15 KG and I call it Wilson. Carried it
  down to Smallbone Park for a bootcamp session.
- I wanted to buy a singlet. James and I cycled to Hallensteins. I bought two
  XS Singlets. Nearly bought some Flamingo shorts. Singlets are great! Not sure
  why I have never owned one before.
- Visited "The Wall" rock climbing gym. Paid $8 to try bouldering for half an
  hour. James sat and watched. I'd like to get him to try it. 
- I wanted Fish & Chips by the lake, but mum wasn't feeling it. Cooked pizza
  instead. I bought a scoop of chips. Cooked blueberry crepes for dessert.

Mittwoch 29
-----------

- Set up Anki with the Linguaphone German vocab. I am serious about studying
  every day. Did a bit of practice tonight. At lesson 6.
- Went for a midday run at Puarenga Park. Another 5km race. Not as quick, but my
  body is a bit sore from yesterday's bootcamp…
- Spent most of the day tidying up my room. Found CJ's RSVP. Going to do to his
  wedding! Also want to list a few items on Trade Me.
- Skated to to the supermarket. Bought Äpfel, Cracker und Käse.
- Corn fritters for dinner. Cheese and crackers for dessert.

Donnerstag 30
-------------

- Headed to small bone park with Wilson (the 15 KG slam ball). Lots of
  carrying, squats, halos, presses, sit ups. Meditated for 15 min. Had the park
  to myself. Rolled down the hill on my side like a dizzy child. No regrets.
- James and I cycled to Waipa (slightly raining). We cycled across Tahi and up
  the hill to do Challenge Roadside at full speed - high adrenaline! We had
  lots of sun and then cycled down the end of dipper to meet our parents at
  secret spot. They hadn't been there before, but they liked it. 
- I cooked up chicken laksa for dinner. Turned out fantastically delicious.

Freitag 31
----------

- Thinking about how to pen source Zwolf. Cycled to PAK'nSAVE, purchased snacks
  (hummus, carrots, äpfel, bikkies) and then chilled at the lakefront in the
  shade.
- We had Fish & Chips for dinner in the backyard. I ordered it and picked it up
  my on bike.
- James scored 34/35 on the mock AA driving test!! We should take him for the
  real test on Monday.

  turned out really well. We listed the car on Trade Me this evening.
