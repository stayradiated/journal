$ DIGITAL JOURNAL

- Completely replaces my physical journal
- Entry for current day
- Notes for current week
- Plain text, no styling
- Commit via Git, edit in Vim
- Does working copy support git-crypt? -> no
- Requirements:
  - Be able to keep private & public notes in the same file
  - Support plain text
  - Editable on desktop & phone
  - Automatically publishes to the web
- Idea: private repo that has a public mirror -- however the public mirror has all the private notes removed

$ BAREFOOT RUNNING

- I started barefoot running on Friday. ~2.5km on grass. I can run fast but it feels more exhausting.
- I quite like waking around Christchurch in barefeet. Everyone wears shoes or jandals. I'm not sure why barefeet isn't more popular. Feel the cool smooth concrete and the lush grass of the parks.
- On Saturday I went out for another run. This tiem >6km on the grass. I now have a few blisters...

$ NO ADDED SUGAR

Things I accendtally consumed while trying to go for a month without added sugar:

- Chai Latte
- Honey & Pistachio Cheese
- Paneer Butter Masala
- Stir Fry Noodles (the sauce)
