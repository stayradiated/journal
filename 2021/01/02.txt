ANNA'S 27th BIRTHDAY

---

Plan for today: go fly a kite! Yesterday, Anna bought several kites from Kmart
that we are going to fly in the park together.

Greg Egan's site is pretty cool -- particulary the section on "Foundations" ::
http://www.gregegan.net/FOUNDATIONS/index.html

Distractionless mornings: I haven't got my chromebook with me while in
Auckland, but I can hit Fn+F8 to toggle the wifi -- this means I can't
accidentally get sucked into the internet while I trying to write.
