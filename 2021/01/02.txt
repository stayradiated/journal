ANNA'S 27th BIRTHDAY

---

Plan for today: go fly a kite! Yesterday, Anna bought several kites from Kmart
that we are going to fly in the park together.

Greg Egan's site is pretty cool -- particulary the section on "Foundations" ::
http://www.gregegan.net/FOUNDATIONS/index.html

Distractionless mornings: I haven't got my chromebook with me while in
Auckland, but I can hit Fn+F8 to toggle the wifi -- this means I can't
accidentally get sucked into the internet while I trying to write.

Exploding Kittens
-----------------

We have all expansions, this is the deck we are playing with:

- all defuse cards
- all exploding kittens
- all plain cat cards (including feral cats)
- all nope cards
- all skip cards
- 4x see the future (3x) cards
- 2x share the future (3x) cards
- 2x alter the future (3x) cards
- 4x attack cards
- 2x curse of the cat butt cards
- 4x shuffle cards
- 4x reverse cards

Playing with the standard rules:

- 2x set of cat cards: blind take a card from a player
- 3x set of cat cards: take a chosen type of card from a player
- 5x different cards: take a card from the discard pile

Works pretty well with 6 people, could be refined further.

Kite Flying
-----------

We headed over to Cornwall Park Cafe around 11am in the morning. I jogged over,
the others drove. The cafe was pretty full, so we kicked a soccer ball while
waiting for a table.

We got a great table, sitting outside (it was so humid!) but under shelter --
which was perfect because it started hammering down with rain. While waiting
for our food we played a game of Exploding Kittens.

For lunch, I had 2 poached eggs on sourdough bread with a date scone ($17).

When it stopped raining we flew kites in the park, with some success! The kites
cost only $3 each and rather small, but required little wind to take off.
Unfortunately the wind was turbulent and unstable and often changed direction
-- however, once the kites had cleared the tops of the trees, the breeze was
more consistent and made flying much easier.

When the rain returned, we took shelter beneath the park rotunda. Chris S
continued to fly his kite between the building and the trees, eventually
getting it stuck in the tops of the tree. After much yanking, the kite came
free but the line was rather knotted. Anna helped him to untangle it.

We kicked the soccer ball around, tossed a $1 Frisbee and continue to fly
kites. It was a fun morning.

RISK
----

Raining all afternoon. Hannah, Chris S, Chris G, Anthony and I all played RISK
for several hours. We played for the first time using the "classic" rules:

Players have 25 armies to place around the board on a territory of their
choice. 

1. Everyone rolls a die -- highest number goes first
2. Each player takes turns to place a single army on an unoccupied territory
3. Once all territories have been occupied, players take turns placing a single
army on a territory they already control until they run out of armies.

Play continues as normal, but without the "CEASE FIRE" card. The game is won
when someone has taken over all territories. 

### Our Game

We played using the classic battle rules, the ones with lots of dice rolls. In
hindsight, we should have played with the "fast" rules with less dice rolls.
Instead of removing armies by hand we kept track of the score on paper to speed
up the battles a little.

- Chris G started in North America
- Anthony started in South America and Australia
- Chris S started in South Africa
- Hannah started in Asia and Europe
- I started spread out between South Africa, Australia and Asia

By the middle of game, Chris G controlled North America and large forces across
the border of West Europe and East Asia. Anthony had large forces in his
control over South America and Australia, Hannah had  control of Europe and
Chris S controlled South Africa. I had a large army in India and the Middle
East.

Chris S and Anthony agreed to attack Chris G, with Chris S attacking from Egypt
into Southern Europe. Anthony took his time, but eventually attacked from
Venezuela into Central America.

I played diplomatic for most of the game, attacking only undefended territories
to avoid losing too many armies.

End game started with Hannah getting bored, shouted "YOLO" and started
attacking everyone on all sides.
