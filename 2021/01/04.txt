Countdown

Fuck you if you love a car for its paint job! Love you if you love a car for the road trips! Show me the miles and your arms and the pink scar where the doctor had to pull out all the bone chips, cuz you were pressing on the gas just a bit hard right in the moment where the road curved a bit sharp and when you woke up, somebody was unclipping your seat belt and pulling you from the open window of your flipped car.
