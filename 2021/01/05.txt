===================

Back to work today!

Woke up at 9am feeling grouchy.

Went for a morning walk around the block with a cup of chai tea.

Listening to first episodes of the "Learnt My Lesson" and "The Oversharers"
podcasts.

Thinking about spending a week in Taupo. Then travelling down to Wellington by
bus. James could fly down to meet me there on the 20th, after he has done his
driving test.

Working from Zippy Central Cafe.

Climing at the wall.
