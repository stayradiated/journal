===================

Back to work today!

Woke up at 9am feeling grouchy.

Went for a morning walk around the block with a cup of chai tea.

Listening to first episodes of the "Learnt My Lesson" and "The Oversharers"
podcasts.

Thinking about spending a week in Taupo. Then travelling down to Wellington by
bus. James could fly down to meet me there on the 20th, after he has done his
driving test. Could also travel to Taupo with James and do a short trip there
together? The bus ride is only an hour. He has his driving test on the 19th.

Mum made banana/pistachio muffins. She is quite a good mood today, I'm not
feeling quite so energetic.

I spent the afternoon working from the Zippy Central Cafe. I ate a PHAT bagel
for lunch with an espresso coffee.

I did a bit of bouldering at the wall, from around 4:15 - 5pm. It's been a
while, so I started with a traverse, followed by completing most of the green
climbs and practicing the easier overhang climbs.

Mum made spaghetti bolognaise for dinner.

I'm aiming to get 10k steps every day this month. I walked to PAK'nSAVE in the
evening, picked up some snacks for tomorrow. They had packets of Oreos for $1
and I caved. Also bought a Whittaker's Peanut Bar for mum and dad.

Watched episode 2 of Death Note. I'm enjoying the logical detective work.
