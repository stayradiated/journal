Baraitser blocked the extradition of Assange! That was a shock, media is
focusing on the mental health aspect and ignoring the inhumane conditions of US
Supermax prisons.

project shed
------------

I would like to redevelop the back shed at my parents house. It would be a good
project to develop skills for constructing a tiny house. 

However, the shed is currently full of "stuff" - most of it hasn't been used in
years. It's a sensitive topic for my mum, who puts it on herself to be in
charge of sorting it out. 

I'm wondering if my parents would be onboard with the idea of turning the shed
into a useable space - and if that helps make them more willing to get rid of
the things we don't need.
