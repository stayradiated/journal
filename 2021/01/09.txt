morning run
-----------

Running around town with shoes on. The muscles in my feet are rather sore, not
sure if that is from climbing or swimming? I ran for 10km, including a lap
around Arawa park which I am quite proud of -- 1.6km in under 6 minutes -- on
long grass in barefeet.

I like the mix of running with shoes on concrete and on grass with barefeet.

lunch
-----

I'm getting a bit tired of the roast pumpkin/chickpea salads. It's also getting
too hot be running the oven -- so I am trying a summer salad.

Todays lunch:

- base of baby kale
- freshly chopped cherry tomatoes, capsicum, cucumber, carrot, red onion
- steamed brocolli, peas and corn
- big spoonfull of hummus

sweetcorn
---------

I cooked dinner this evening -- honey soy chicken drumsticks and barbecued
sweetcorn.

I cooked the sweetcorn on the barbecue, this time leaving the husks on. 

My process:

1. Strip back the husks and remove the stringy bits
2. Rub corn with oil
3. Rollback husks
4. Grill on BBQ for 20 minutes

This worked pretty well, however the husks dried out very quickly and started
catching fire. Next time, I would try soaking the husks in water for 20 minutes
so that they didn't burn so much. This might also help to steam the corn.
