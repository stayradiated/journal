Sunday 10 Jan 2021
==================

Still getting used to typing 2021.

- Starting the day at 8am. What can I change to wake up earlier? I need more
  light in the morning.
- Working on cleaning up the mish monorepo, all the packages now pass the
  linting rules - still a few packages that need tests fixed.
- heading into town for the Rotorua Farmers Market at 10am
- Zoe Scott is performing at the market today (@whoiszoescott).
- Ran into Matthew G. and his mother walking through town.

Boating
-------

Planning to catch up with Anna and Chris G today -- aiming for sometime around
1. It's not looking like a lot of wind today, so we will probably just use the
motor and have an explore around one of the lakes.

Going to bike over to Friskin Pl.

Travel
------

I've got tickets for James to fly down to Wellington on the 28th Jan.

I need to book my own travel route -- I'm not sure if I'm going to be taking
the bus or flying down with him.

I'd like to get my work with Mish finished before I leave Rotorua -- it's very
tempting to head off but I know I have more time for programming when I am
home.

Music
-----

I should checkout latest Tiny Ruins album "Olympic Girls".

Going to create a list of music to checkout. See [[ /lists/music_todo.txt ]]
