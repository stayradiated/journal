==================

Taking monday off work.

- morning barefoot run around Arawa Park Raceway (8km)
- 30min swim at the aquatic centre, I am getting used to breathing underwater
- returned "Perihelion Summer"
- hanging out at the public library with my laptop, hoping mum will meet me for
  a coffee at Bird the Word around midday.
