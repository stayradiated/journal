==================

Taking monday off work.

- morning barefoot run around Arawa Park Raceway (8km)
- 30min swim at the aquatic centre, I am getting used to breathing underwater
- returned "Perihelion Summer"
- hanging out at the public library with my laptop, hoping mum will meet me for
  a coffee at Bird the Word around midday.
- waiting for mum to arrive at the cafe, it's nearly 1pm and I still haven't
  eaten anything. This is a great day for fasting.
- Great catch up with mum at Bird the Word cafe. Chatting about when she used
  to live in Sydney and her first new car. I bought a large slice of apple cake
  and two coffees.
- Cycling home 
- Visiting the climbing wall in the afternoon. Completed all of the blue climbs
  ("novice samurai" level) except for the "blue arrow" on the far left, which
  has only 5 holds and excludes the box and arÃªte. Attempted to try the yellow
  routes ("samurai" level) -- they are all beyond my comprehension for now.

pavlova
-------

I would like to make another Pavlova tonight, this time I will use the little
oven. We have plenty of cream and blueberries leftover as well.

Update: the pavlova turned out amazing!

Notes for next time:

- use the lower tray in the little oven, the crust of the pavlova will rise
  while baking and can singe if it gets too close to the top element.
- the thicker you can whisk the meringue the better, as it makes it easier to
  shape on the baking tray
- you don't need to add sugar to the whipped cream

books
-----

I am  loobing at books to rent from the library, but few the books I want to
read are available and I already have them on my kindle.

I also have several physical books sitting in my room that I have yet to read,
so I should probably start on those first.

I would like to sell most of my books, I have enough stuff as it is. Most
novels are easier to read on a kindle anyway.

- all monorepo tests are now passing, ready to create a PR
- aim to finish developing receiveSnap and make sure the snapturbo methods
  are working (downloadFile, updateSnaps) as expected.
