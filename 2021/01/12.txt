===================

Parents are heading over to Hamilton today to look a car.

I'm sticking around home this morning to make sure James makes it to his
driving lesson at 10:15am.

Morning walk around the block, listening to The Oversharers podcast, picking up
trash and broken glass.

Baking some delicious biscuits! Using the leftover egg yolks from past
Pavlovas. Added crushed hazelnut and sultanas -- so tasty!

Listening to "The Tough Aliance -- Miami". It's a track I've had for years but
hadn't yet rated in Plex. It's so energetic and optimistic!

Parent's have returned with the new Ipsum.

I want to fly a kite. James and I cycled to Kmart and each bought $8 kites. We
tried flying them at Smallbone park with some success.

Evening drive with the family in the "new" 2005 Ipsum. It's quite a nice car,
with great air conditioning. I brought along a CD of the Walkmen album
"Heaven". Mum isn't a fan.

Watching the 9th episode of Death Note. I should try scheduling TV around 8:30
so that I can avoid using my laptop after 9pm. Still aiming to wake up earlier.
