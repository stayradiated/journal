=====================

Working from Ciabatta this morning (they are open again!)

Thinking about working from the Basecamp co-working space twice a week ($35 a
day). Perhaps Wednesdays and Thursdays? Would be nice to have good internet for
the dev meetings.

I think the Lenovo Thinkpad Gen 9 is going to be my next laptop. Before I
purchases it, I would to like to see that it supports running linux.

After the design meeting, I rode over to the Aquatic Centre. Swam a few laps
back and forth, feeling a bit more confident in the water. Focusing on getting
two full strokes before I turn my head to breath -- the feeling of running out
of air while swimming is tough to overcome, but I am making progress.

Cycled back home for lunch, prepared another summer salad with avocado - so
tasty! Reading the last chapters of "Permutation City". Ate the last of the
biscuits.

Visiting the climbing wall in the evening, improving my technique on the blue
climbs. Stretching my forearms before I climb, noticing that the pain in my
left arm is really in my bicep. Need to find a good stretch for that muscle.

Mum cooked cumin potatoes, chicken, sweetcorn and brocolli for dinner. I
defrosted turkish bread in the oven.

Watching episode 10 of DeathNote - the tennis match between Light and L is well
done, I like how they every interaction they have has a deeper meaning to it.

Finished reading "Permutation City". It's a great book about living in a
simulation and what it means to be "real". 

I am going to finish Pullman's "Northern Lights" novel next, I've got half way
to go.

retrospective:
--------------

We have got the first dev retrospective tomorrow, I should spend 30min today
thinking about things to bring up.

- outcome of the retrospective:
  - 1 action/week between meetings

- using Runn to track what we are working on
- I'd like to try daily 10am standups
  - everyone writes down what they are working on in #development 
  - we catch up at 10am for a quick hello
  - talk about anything blocking us
  - max of 15 minutes
- run a retrospective more often - once every 2 weeks?
- demo what we are working on to the team, could be async
