waking Up
---------

Awake at 6am. Drifting in and out of sleep for 2 hours. I need to force
myself to get up. I will try moving my alarm to the opposite side of the bed.

I haven't had a hot morning shower in a while, that would be a good carrot.

I could do a lot with an extra hour in the morning.

Sunrise is 6:06am. I know I can wake up at that time, I just need to get myself
out of bed.

work
----

I want to work from the local co-working space in Rotorua "Digital Basecamp". I
cycled past at 9:15am but it didn't look very alive.

I'm just having a coffee at the AVC, I'll head back at 10am and have another
look. I will also need somewhere to park my bike.

Contacted Digital Basecamp through their Facebook page. I will meet them at
11am and pay in cash. I should have done this yesterday.

Sitting at starbucks, probably didn't need to buy a coffee to sit outside, but
I did anyway. They have free wifi in town, 15mbs down is pretty decent.

Working from Digital Basecamp for the rest of the day. Paid $40 in cash. They
will email an invoice.

There is only one other chap in here, I think his name is Daniel. I like the
quiet. I'm thinking of working here one or two days a week.

retro
-----

ideas for running the february retrospective:

- first, follow up on the previous action items
- use figma!
- get everyone to edit the same figma document and create sticky notes
- we can then organise the notes into groups and discuss them
- create several action items
- ask if anyone would like to host the next retrospective else pick a person
