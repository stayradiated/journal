waking Up
---------

Awake at 6am. Drifting in and out of sleep for 2 hours. I need to force
myself to get up. I will try moving my alarm to the opposite side of the bed.

I haven't had a hot morning shower in a while, that would be a good carrot.

I could do a lot with an extra hour in the morning.

Sunrise is 6:06am. I know I can wake up at that time, I just need to get myself
out of bed.

work
----

I want to work from the local co-working space in Rotorua "Digital Basecamp". I
cycled past at 9:15am but it didn't look very alive.

I'm just having a coffee at the AVC, I'll head back at 10am and have another
look. I will also need somewhere to park my bike.
