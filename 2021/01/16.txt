====================

morning
-------

Woke up to my alarm at 6:30am. Set another alarm for 7am and went back to
sleep... But the 7am alarm got me out of bed.

I think I need to set a hard limit for fasting in the evenings. For example, no
food after 8pm. This is difficult around my family, but I will do my best.

Went for a morning walk around the block with a cup of tea. I haven't done that
in a while. My feet are a bit sore -- like the actual feet muscles are aching?
Maybe I overdid the running this week? I'm not sure, just going to take it easy
this weekend.

Back to work on the mish.

pflaumenkuchen
--------------

We have a bucket of plums. I want to try making a plum sheet desert again. This
involves pitting the plums, which isn't easy -- I will ask James to help me.

Things worth trying out:
