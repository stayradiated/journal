==================

- morning walk

- working on mish 
- cycle up to centennial park
- watching "Soul" (2020), fantastic film

mish
----

Finished porting allupdates to typescript.

Created a "system-test" package to automate testing and development.

Proxying the emulated app to check that I am marking snaps as screenshotted
correctly.

Found that I had a null `addedFriendsTimestamp` which was breaking the API call.

next up: 

- I would like to get addSnapToStory working locally
- Use autoforward service to test that service is working

fasting
-------

Started fasting at 6:30pm. Mum made custard for dessert so I cheated and had
a bowl of that.

I would like to get back into a stricter routine with my fasting. Need to make
sure that we have dinner earlier in the day. If this isn't possible, I should
try having lunch as late as possible.
