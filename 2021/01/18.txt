==================

- Waking up at 6:30am. Reading todayintabs in bed. In the shower before 7am.
  Not the best morning routine but it's better than lying in bed for an extra
  hour.
- Shaving and trimming my beard this morning, not too shabby.
- Just realised I haven't written goals for a long time. Created [[ /2021/01/goals ]] page.
- Working from Gr√∏unded cafe this morning.
