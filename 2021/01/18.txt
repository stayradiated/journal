Monday 18 Jan 2021
==================

- Waking up at 6:30am. Reading todayintabs in bed. In the shower before 7am.
  Not the best morning routine but it's better than lying in bed for an extra
  hour.
- Shaving and trimming my beard this morning, not too shabby.
- Just realised I haven't written goals for a long time.
  Created the [[ /2021/01/goals ]] page.
- Working from Gr√∏unded cafe this morning.
- Swimming (feeling more confident, want to try swimming 50m lengths and start
  counting how many laps I do each session).
- Bouldering (mastering the blue climbs)
- Cooking a butter chicken curry for dinner. I am definitely doing a veggie
  month in February.

standup
-------

1. be ready and in the meeting room at 9:55am
2. post link to #general before 10am
3. be more assertive at the start.

Tomorrow, suggest that we do standup by giving everyone an uninteruppted minute
to say what they are up to.

And then people can leave if they want, or stick around if they have questions.

I've configured zoom to disable the "waiting room" feature.
