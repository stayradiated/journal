===================

- out of bed before the 6:30 alarm even goes off! this is fantastic progress
- working from home this morning, tempeted to leave the house but it is looking
  so drab and grey
- standup at 10am, wasn't looking forward to it but it went better than I
  expected
- work: get Hasura running on CI so we can run the cypress tests
- I have a 1-1 with Rowan tomorrow afternoon, I should have a think about
  anything I want to discuss

      his driving)

James has his restricted driving license test today. I hope he does well. The
test is very difficult - there is an average 60% pass rate, which seems quite
low. That's a 16% chance of failing twice in a row.

Whatever happens, James has done an amazing job to make it this far. I would
like to take everyone out for a lunch (or dinner?) 

Update: He didn't pass :(

I'm going to bring him a Smokie sandwhich from Ciabatta - one of his favourite
meals. He really enjoyed it.

We went out to dinner in the evening - a casual meal at CBK in town. I had the
fish & chips and a glass of the GG Doris Plum Cider.
