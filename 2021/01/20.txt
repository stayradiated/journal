=====================

catching up with Jacob this morning, debugging some mish stuff. Seems to be
working. Demo'd what I've currently got going on.

- no standup today, we have the weekly dev meeting at 10am instead.
- working from Digital Basecamp today. There are 3 other people here today!
- grabbing subway for lunch
- budgeting $2k for the next 2 weeks, should be plenty for the trip to
  Wellington with James.
- Planning to work Monday next week, but take the 29th off -- so I get a 4 day
  holiday to show James around Wellington.
