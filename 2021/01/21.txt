====================

Well, it's official, Joe Biden is the 46th president of the United States.

- Up and out of bed at 6:30am. Not feeling 100% but so happy to be back in a
  regular schedule. I should grab some more Echinacea tablets.
- It is cold! Out for a morning walk without shoes and my feet were freezing, I
  could even see my breath! It's warm in the sun but the breeze has a chill to
  it.
- Short swimming session at the Aquatic Centre. First time counting the number
  of laps -- I did 20 in 20 minutes. I reckon I could do at least 30 next time.
- Working from the library in the afternoon, participating in the Future Work
  Meeting, where we go through the Producte Development Pipeline.
- I'm sitting in the library and it's started raining outside :( 
- It's stopped raining, going to cycle home now
- Feeling quite tired, going to have an afternoon nap.
- Woke up at 4pm, had a shower and a cup of tea. Feeling a bit better now. I am
  glad I bought that Echinacea.

travel:
-------

Need to start thinking ahead with my travel - which cities do I want to visit,
where do I want to stay, how do I want to get there?

I would like to stay in Wellington for the week after James leaves, and work
with the Runn team there.

Then maybe catch the ferry across to Picton? Can you ferry anywhere else? There
is also a train I could catch.
 
It's $60 to catch the ferry to Picton, that's pretty decent. Do I want to lock
in the trip now? Yep, I can reschedule the booking later for free if I have to.

There is also the Coastal Pacific train from Picton to Christchurch. I could
stop at each place and stay a few nights.

- Picton
- Blenheim
- Kaikoura
- Rangiora
- Christchurch

I have spent plenty of time in Picton and Christchurch by myself. I've visited
Blenheim with my friends on a road trip. Jo and I visited Kaikoura together
back in 2018. I've never been to Rangiora. It could be a fun week!

Also need to factor in Waitangi Day.

I should really book my accomodation for Wellington now. Do I want to spend
another week in the Wellington YHA? It would be nice to try somewhere else, but
I don't want to spend more than $40 a night.
