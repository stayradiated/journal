==================

Out of bed at 7am.

It's a beautiful sunny morning, I strolled around the block with a cup of tea
and listened to "The Hunt for Disease X"
(https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs/wbhrdev/presenting-coronavirus-fact-vs-fiction)

Catching up with Rowan at 10am for standup. Talking through my plan to
"quietly" deploy Hasura to production.

At midday we have a team lunch scheduled. Not sure what the plan is there...

...

Going out for a morning run around 11am. Cycling to Smallbone Park with the
soccer ball. Running 5km in laps around the cricket pitch. The muscles in my
feet are still sore - particularly around the pads of my middle toes - I should
probably look up some stretches for them.

...

Team Lunch was pretty fun actually. I had joined around 12:20am, with several
bowls of food (fried dumplings, summer salad, steamed veggies, dates & peanut
butter, a frozen blueberry muffin).

We had several people turn up: Rowan, Nicole, Dan, Shannon, Priscilla and Ruth.

We are going to try a team lunch again in a month.

...

Catching up with mum at Bird the Word cafe. She drove us there in the new Kia
Seltos car -- my first trip in it. I like how easy it is to play music from my
phone. I shouted us each a coffee.

Mum is going to visit her friend Hema. I walked to the public library
afterwards to finish off work for the day.

...

I've booked James and I into the Weta Workshop for Saturday 30th January. We
are going to go on a tour in the morning and then try one of workshops in the
afternoon.
