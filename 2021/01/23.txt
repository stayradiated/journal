====================

- out of bed at sunrise!
- working on @mishguru/storage - it's a light-weight wrapper around the S3 API
  - but it also supports writing to the filesystem so you can use it locally.
- morning walk around the block, listening to dithering
- having a free coffee at Gr√∏unded, typing at notes for [[ 2020/week/05 ]].
- trying to organize a weekend trip out to the Coromandel for early march.
- the Pelican has left Golfito and is on it's way back to the Panama canal.
