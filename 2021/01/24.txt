Sunday 24 Jan 2021
==================

- Waking up at sunrise, have a slight headache.
- Working on Mish Guru this morning, I have made great progress on migrating
  the AddSnapToStory project to Typescript. I just have a few tests left to do.
- Cycling to the Rotorua's Farmers Market. No blueberries today! Nearly left,
  but I decided to grab an almond croissant and a coffee and stick around. I
  have been working pretty hard this week, it's nice to have a short break.

tiramisu
--------

- This evening I cycled to Countdown and purchased a tub of thickened cream and
  two packets of Vittoria Biscotti Sponge Fingers.
- I combined these two recipes:
  - https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/recipedetail/9445/easy-tiramisu
  - https://urbanduniya.com/recipe-tiramisu/

:: ingredients

- 300mls boiling water
- 1Â½ Tbsp instant coffee granules
- 1 tsp rum essence
- 100g icing sugar
- 300ml tub of thickened cream
- 500g marscapone
- 1 pack of Vittoria Biscotti Sponge Fingers
- cocoa powder (for dusting)

:: method

1. Mix instant coffee with water, leave to cool in the freezer (you don't want
   to burn your fingers in step 3!)
2. Combine icing sugar, thickened cream and marscapone.
3. Quickly dunk each biscuit in the coffee than place in the bottom of a tray
4. Repeat until the bottom of the tray is covered
5. Take half of the marscapone mixture and smear it on top of th ebiscuits
6. Create another layer of coffee soaked biscuits on top
7. Cover the biscuits with the remaining marscapone  
8. Dust with cocoa
9. Leave in the fridge for at least an hour
