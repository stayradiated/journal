==================

- Up at sunrise, but snoozing in bed until 7:45am. Feeling a lot healthier this
  morning than I was last night.
- Strolling around the block with a hot cup of Rooibos and listening to the Off
  Menu podcast. Editing the Tiramisu video from yesterday while sitting on the
  park bench near the golf course.
- Mum is freaking out about a series of small earthquakes near Rotorua. I
  haven't felt any of them. I suggest that it would be a good day to check our
  emergency supplies and see if anything needs replacing or adding.
- Working from the Coffee Collective cafe in town. Quite a popular spot, with
  great seating and cheap coffee. However they don't have wifi.
