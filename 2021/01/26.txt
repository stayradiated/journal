8:20 at Lotus Cafe

Sitting with a cup of Earl Grey tea at Lotus Cafe. Waiting for the MyRide
repair shop to open up at 8:30. While cycling into town the rear tyre on my
bike suddenly went flat -- I had to walk it the rest of the way.

I took the bike into the shop and the guy there repaired it on the spot, within
10 minutes, fantastic service. Only cost $20 as well.

9:00 at Fat Dog cafe

- running into Mum, Sarah and Maureen. Mum is up early because she was dropping
  our neighbour, Hillary, at the bus stop.
- working from a table out the front

swimming
--------

Continuing to practice breathing after 3 strokes, would like to try doing 50m
laps next time.

temperature
-----------

It's so hot! Working from my office in the afternoon, the air temperature
inside reached 33.5Â°!

Set up the Dyson Hot+Cool fan on my desk, but it doesn't do a very good job of
cooling, just blowing hot air at me.

dinner
------

Mum cooked chicken kebabs with coconut rice. I made a salad and microwaved some
peas and sweetcorn.

We finished off the last of the Tiramisu, such a tasty dessert.

bike ride
---------

After dinner, James and I went for a bike ride around town, up Old Taupo Road,
down Lake Road across to Sulphur Point and then back home.

There are a couple of trees that have toppled sideways into the bay, but are
still living. You can stand on top of them above the water.
