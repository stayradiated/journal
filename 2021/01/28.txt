====================

It will be a pleasant change to get out of Rotorua.

travelling
----------

Mum dropped us off at the airport this mroning. Sarah joined us at the airport
cafe. I spent the last 15 minutes in Rotorua quickly configure james phone to
access his zoho mail account. Then resetting the password for his google
account, which didn't actually require email access (!) so we could purchase a
premium subscription to YouTube -- this lets James download music to his phone
so he has something to listen to during the flight.

We boarded the plane at 1015, sitting in row 9, just behind the wing. 

The plane landed with some gut tumbling turblence at 1130. I was expecting to catch the regular Airporter bus into town, but it's not running at the moment. We caught an alternative bus, the #2, which is a 7 minute walk from the bus stop. It's only $5pp which is a lot cheaper than the regular $12pp that the Airporter charges. 

It's not raining in Wellington, which is a pleasant surprise, but it's windy as
usual.

We had BurgerFuel for lunch. James hadn't had BurgerFuel for years and it was
in a convenient location.

We had a quick look out over the harbour, it's a rather windy day.

We visited the Te Papa museum. I sat in the cafe, working on my laptop. James
explored the different exhibitions for 2 hours.

Walking back, we stopped at New World so James could grab some granola and
milk. I bought some rooibos tea.

I wanted to get 2x CR2 batteries for my instant-film camera, but New World
didn't have them, so we walked all the way to Jaycar. I bought the batteries,
but we got caught in heavy rain on the way back. My bag got soaked, fortunately
I had brought along my dry-bag, which I placed my laptop in, to keep it safe.
