==================

Taking the day off today.

- Up at 6:55
- Trying to figure out a plan of attack for today
- Working on Mish Guru -- I want to test out all the services locally.
  - Setting them all up to run inside docker
- James is up at 10:30, having granola for breakfast in the lounge
 
Yesterday was surprisingly sunny, we spent the morning walking around town -
along the waterfront, up to the Beehive, down Lambton Quay, along Cuba St.

James is great at recognising cars. He pointed out an electric Porsche that was
painted in the style of Van Gogh. 

We had lunch at Fidel's Cafe. I had the Vegan Bowl, James had the Salmon Bagel.

We walked back to the harbour. On the way we passed through Leeds St, where Fix
and Fogg have their little store. I tried a few of the peanut butters and
bought a slice of toast with the Coffee & Maple peanut butter lathered on
thick. Delicious!

We hired two of the orange Uber electric scooters and zipped around the bay,
covering ~7km. We stopped at the Zephyrometer wind sculpture and started
walking back into town.

Did you know the Zephyrometer was struck by lightning in 2014? Someone even got
a video of it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2NLJOZnC2w

It was such a great day, I thought it would a good idea to head to Zealandia. I
ordered us an Uber to save us an extra hour of walking.

James needs a water bottle, we looked at buying one at Zealandia, but they
didn't have anything reasonable.

We walked around Zealandia for 2 hours. We saw lots of quails, a stick insect,
2 Takahē, a Tuatara, Tuis, lots of small birds, a Kererū, a Kākā.
