heute
-----

Up and out of bed at 6:40. Quick shower and shave. Working from the kitchen
this morning.

I need to get James and I out of the room by 10am. I will be leaving James on
his own for a few hours, he might get a bit bored, but I'm sure he will be
fine. He might even enjoy the break from being around me non-stop since
Thursday.

James is flying back to Rotorua today. His flight is at 1435.

I have a team lunch with the Wellington Runn crew at midday. I will need to
leave at 1300 to hurry back to the Marion hostel, grab James, jump in an Uber
and head to the airport. I want to be at the airport by 1410 at the latest.

...

We caught the uber, leaving at 1320, only cost $20.

Made it there with plenty of time to spare. James bought a Reuben sandwhich for
lunch, I picked up a PBJ bagel from Best Ugly and shared it with him.

He is certainly a lot more confident getting on the plane this time.

I got some cash out at the petrol station and caught the #2 bus back into town
($5).

----

It seems like ages since I last did any work, but it's only been 5 days. I need

- [x] Read Intercom comms email that Nicole forwarded me

It's Chris's birthday coming up soon, I need to figure out a present for him.

Friends are keen to get him a Phillip Hues Play 2 pack for $200 ($40pp).

Still keen to try organize a group adventure out to the Coromandel in March,
the others are interested, I just need to keep pushing to make it happen.

I went out foa another run this afternoon. Great atmosphere, there was a
running race on, so the streets were packed.

I would like to get a pair of minimalist running shoes.
