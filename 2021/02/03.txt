=====================

Up and out of bed at 0640. My feet are feeling quite sore from the run
yesterday. I really should get myself some running shoes. I quite like the idea
of the Softstar RunAmoc or the Sockwa x8.

Working from the BNZ Partner Office again today. I've brought a packed lunch,
which I am very much looking forward to.

Going to leave the office at 4pm. I've got to work this evening -- we have a
call with a customer at 7pm.

After work, I ran down to the beach at Oriental Bay and had a refreshing swim
in the water. 

My feet and legs need a break from barefoot running.

After the evening work call, I sat on the rooftop deck with a hot cocoa,
watching Kenyen, Marcus, David, Noah and Kesh play Catan. I don't understand
how this game got so popular, maybe the expansions are really good.

At 7pm I was on a call with Nicole and Ruth, discussing "cost based projects"
with a potential customer.

- already has a revenue budget that they will bill the customer
- "resource risk" and "margin"
- needs to know the percent of margin and the value of the margin
- display the explicit breakdown of revenue and cost into actual/scheduled
