Oh, haha, I paid $50 to travel 26 minutes on a train… I should have booked the
bus…

--------

0830 BNZ office opens

funds
-----

Looking at transferring some cash from my N26 bank account over so I can invest
it -- but I can't transfer any funds unless I pair my phone and that requires I
have my physical N26 card with me (which I didn't bring).

I could ask my parents, but it's probably worth just waiting until I get back
to Rotorua.

Hmm, I wonder if my old iphone is still paired with my N26 account? That could
be worth checking…

I would like to make the most of my time in Wellington.

Do you want to view all the commits that changed a particular file?

   git log --follow -- ./path/to/your/file

It works perfectly!

income tax
----------

I need to sort out my taxes for my work with mish. I've gone to the IRD website
and requested to declare income for "self-employment".

Need to make sure I keep some money aside to pay for the GST and the income tax.
