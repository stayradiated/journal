====================

I haven't heard back from the Blenhleim hostel yet.

Oh, haha, I paid $50 to travel 26 minutes on a train… I should have booked the
bus…

travel plan
-----------

feb 06: 0800 ferry from wellington to picton
        1300 check-in at tombstone hostel
feb 09: 1340 train departs picton
        1406 train arrives blenheim
feb 16:      train departs blenheim
             train arrives kaikoura

schedule
--------

0800 prep salad for lunch
0815 walk to BNZ office
0830 BNZ office opens

funds
-----

Looking at transferring some cash from my N26 bank account over so I can invest
it -- but I can't transfer any funds unless I pair my phone and that requires I
have my physical N26 card with me (which I didn't bring).

I could ask my parents, but it's probably worth just waiting until I get back
to Rotorua.

Hmm, I wonder if my old iphone is still paired with my N26 account? That could
be worth checking…

shoes

I would like to make the most of my time in Wellington.
