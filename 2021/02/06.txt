swimming
--------

Upon arriving in Picton, the weather was quite cloudy but around 1530 the
clouds broke and it really heated up. I changed into my togs and dove into the
water at Shelly Beach. The water was freezing at first, but I soon adjusted to
the temperatured and really enjoyed the swim.

I would like to go swimming again tomorrow.

monday
------

I have booked a mountain bike ride for Monday. 
I need to be at Marlborough Sounds Adventures Co. at 7:30am.

I will be taking the water taxi to Mistletoe Bay at 8am.

Considering switching to the more difficult track of Punga to Torea bay.
