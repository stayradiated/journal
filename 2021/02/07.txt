going to rebuild everything in golang and use watermill.io.

sudo

`sudo -v` (short for --validate) is a handy command for adding to the start of
your bash one-liners when you want to make sure your sudo command is validated
before you statr doing stuff.

for example:

  sudo -v && curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -
