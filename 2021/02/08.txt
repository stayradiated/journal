==================

Mountain biking along the Queen Charlotte Track today.

Up and out at 6am.

I arrived at the Marlborough Sounds Adventure Co. at 0730, as instructed -- but
there was nobody there! Eventually someone arrived at 0800, they didn't realise
I had a booking for that morning.

Fortunately, there was another boat leaving at 1000 which I could take. They
assigned me a mountain bike, a very flash SCOTT Scale bike with suspension
lock, lots of gears and disc brakes.

My right ankle is quite sore, I think I injured myself running in those Ecco
shoes yesterday.

- rode out to waikawa marina and back
- Cougar Line boats took me out to Torea Bay
- picked up at 1530 from Anikiwa

Stir fry for dinner, with a cup of miso soup.

Washing all my clothes and hanging them out to dry on the line.

Sewing the piwakawaka patch to my bag.
