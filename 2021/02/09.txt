===================

Today I am travelling by train to Blenheim.

It's raining in Picton today.

Gary from Tombstone said he'd be keen to have me work for them. They are
looking for staff. I should try living in Picton for a month. I could work in
the evenings.

Is a short black just an espresso shot? Maybe it just depends on the size of
the cup.

A long black is just a short black but they also give you a seperate pitcher of
hot water.

afternoon
---------

Waiting for the train at Picton train station. Sitting next to a woman from
Palmerston North, a doctor on vacation. She is travelling to Christchurch, a 6
hour journey. Tomorrow she is hiring a campervan, planning on travelling around
the South Island for a month and a half.

I realise I no longer have my water bottle -- I probably left it in the Picton
library :(

Train arrives in Blenheim. I get off and walk to the Grapevine hostel. An
envelope is attached to the door with "George" written on it. Inside is a
printed note with instructions on where my room is. I have a bed in a 6-bedroom
dorm and my own cutlery.

I meet one of my dorm-mates, Ellen, a british girl who has been living in New
Zealand for the last 6 years. She has been working a gig in an ice cream van --
she was actually in Picton over the weekend -- I don't remember seeing the van
though. Ellen is keen to go out for a walk somewhere around Blenheim, I think
that would be fun.

I borrowed one of the hostel bikes, the only one that was in a working
condition. The rear brake was dislocated and the gears were limited to a single
configuration. I brought the bike into a like cycle shop and they fixed up the
brakes but pointed out that the rear wheel was severely buckled and would need
replacing. I asked if they had time this week, the guy laughed and said they
wouldn't be able to do anything till March.

I cycled to the local Library and parked the bike out the front. I didn't bring
a lock with me so I sat by the window and kept an eye on the bike while I
worked on my laptop. Unfortunately, when I looked out the window I noticed the
bike was gone! Someone had ridden off with it. I couldn't believe anyone would
bother taking the bike. Fortunately I still have the helmet. I will have to
walk back to the hostel and explain what happened.

evening
-------

I walked back to the hostel, arriving promptly at 5pm. I met with Haleigh, who
checked me into the hostel. Total cost for a week is only $140, which is pretty
cheap. I explained to her about the stolen bike, she said not to worry about it.

I still felt pretty bad about the bike, so I found one on TradeMe in Blenheim
for $150 and hit the buy now. It looks a pretty awesome bike, the guy selling
it put it together himself from parts. (It's the Avanti Hammer Pro, link
above).

Ellen is going camping with her friend this evening. I walked to the New World
to pick up some groceries. I only bought the minimum necessary for a single
dinner - I wasn't sure how lucky I would be with fridge space. I  also purchase
a new Sistema water bottle, this time in a different colour. What can I do to
not lose this one?

I cooked up another veggie stir-fry for dinner. Cooking in the hostel kitchen
is an acrobatic exercise, with several people cooking at once on only so much
space for chopping boards and frying pans. Christina kindly let me use some of
her olive oil, I will need to purchase a small bottle of my own.

Sitting outside, chatting with Christina, Pia and Brian. We played Exploding
Kittens together. Talking coronavirus, vaccines, politics with Luka, a large
German ex-paramedic. I went to bed at 10pm. Ear-plugs are essential.
