=====================

Matt is a legend - offering to drop the bike off around 9am. This is way better
than having to get 10km out to Fairhill and then ride back.

It's a 10 minute walk to the nearest ATM to get cash out. Will it stop raining?

Bryan told me that Youn had collapsed last night. The paramedics arrived, but
he didn't want to leave the Hostel. Very alarming, apparently he is ok, just
"had a helluva night".

This hostel reminds me a lot of my time at the Tasman Bay Backpackers. Lots of
young people from different backgrounds all living together.

Is it possible to get a helmet? Yes, $60 from the bike shop for a regular
helmet. $80 for a nice skate helmet. $30 for a pair of regular pedals.
