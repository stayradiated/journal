- Alarm set for 0530. Up at 0600.
- Ellen leaves for the Queen Charlottle Track this morning. Pia is dropping her
  off in Picton.
- The headphone jack in Ellen's iPhone doesn't work - I grabbed a pin and
  cleaned out a stuck piece of lint - it works again now!

You should get better at sharing.

Just offer everything you have to everybody, all of the time.
Don't be afraid of rejection.
