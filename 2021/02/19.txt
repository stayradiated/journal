==================

I put out the banana cake for people to enjoy this morning.

Ellen is back from her hiking this aftenoon (~5pm)

I am staying one more night at the Grapevine, heading to Kaikoura tomorrow.
Packed up my gear to move out of the Wither Hills room and into the Montana
room.

Kind of want to make Tiramisu for desert tonight. Seems do-able.
