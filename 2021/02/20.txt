====================

travelling to kaikoura today.

so tired right now.

Jaime drove to me to Kaikoura this morning. She is here for one night, this
afternoon she will be out surfing. Tomorrow she is hiking up Mt Fyffe - I will
be joining her.

Re-assembled my bike and checked-in to the Albatross hostel. Will be here for a
whole week.

- subway for lunch. ate a whole bag of popcorn.
- cycling to the Kaikoura peninsula.
- bought a pohutakawa patch from a gift store
- ice cream!
- afternoon nap.
- shopping for tomorrows lunch at new world.
- kumara chips and hummus for dinner

It's so chill here, it's amazing. The Blenheim Grapevine is a great hostel and
the people are amazing, but I do like having some quiet time to reflect.

I bought a men's multivitamin ($20) - because the woman from the Picton hostela
recommended them (I don't know if I ever got her name?). I quite like the
packaging.

--------

plan is to hike it tomorrow with Jaime.

I should wear shoes.

I should also take food:

- dates
- apricots
- biscuits
- pringles
- date balls
- need lots of water

Do I need another water bottle? I only have tiny water bottles. I should get
something that can hold a litre. What about something that collapses? I hate
how much space water bottles take up when they are empty.

Hunting & Fishing have one for $30. Seems a bit pricey. I could just get a
regular bottle for tenth of the cost.
