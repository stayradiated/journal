==================

I bought a 1L platypus slim water bottle from Hunting & Fishing.

Jaime is going to head to Mt Fyffe at 11am.

I am currently packing my bag.

...

Jaime has been out walking a dog with her friend at Kaikoura Peninsula.
However, the dog has bolted and now Jaime is trying to find it. Her friend has
a bad back and can't help too much. I offered to help but they are quite far
away.

...

They found the dog, thank the lord.

...

Jaime picked me up at 1240 in her little white Toyota. We drove out to the Mt.
Fyffe carpark and started the ascent at 1330.

We saw 7 other people on the trail. Three couples walking down on our ascent,
and one man walking up to the hut on our descent.

The views over the Kaikouras were gorgeous and were even better at sunset. We
could see the entire peninsula and most of the surrounding area.

Jaime wanted some time to enjoy the view to herself, so I left her and
continued to the summit by myself, arriving at 1700. I had a bite to eat and
then returned back down the steep gravel pathway.

I slipped on the rocks and scraped skin off both palms, causing them to bleed
slightly. Jaime had some plasters in her bag I used to protect them.

On the down Jaime was in quite a lot of pain from an ingrown toenail hitting
her hiking shoes. We had over 8km to cover and she powered on through all the
way down to the car.

...

Arrived back at the hostel at 2000.

Eating ciabatta bread, oil and dukkah - with peanutbutter, dates, apicots,
apples and choc-chip biscuits with rooibos tea. Not very healthy but delicious.

Off to bed at 2115, continuing to read Wool. Juliette can't drown right? That
would be awful.
