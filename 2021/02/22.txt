Monday 22 Feb 2021
==================

I have the day off work.
What to accomplish with my time?

- [x] morning run â†’ painful 3km run on gravel road
- [x] reply to Jacob about rainbowphone
- [ ] I would like to get the rezd app working again
- [ ] Edit and publish video to youtube
- [ ] Looking forward to catching up with Jo today.
- [ ] Where am I going to stay in Christchurch? Not the YHA, somewhere different.

running
-------

Kaikoura beach is not great for barefoot running.

I'm considering cycling out to the Peninsula and trying the paths out there,
better views, no cars and perhaps less harsh on the soles.

shopping
--------

New World Kaikoura
Open from 0800 to 2000.
Can walk along the beach to get there, it's a 30 minute walk (one-way).

groceries for lunch:

- [ ] spinach
- [ ] carrots
- [ ] brocolli
- [ ] cucumber
- [ ] capsicum
- [ ] red onion
- [ ] hummus

stir fry:

- [ ] sweet corn
- [ ] low-salt soy sauce
- [ ] quinoa

fruits:

- [ ] apples
- [ ] bananas

other:

- [ ] milk for tea would be heaven, look for vegan options
- [ ] waterproof plasters for my palms
- [ ] do NOT buy peanut butter, you've had enough
