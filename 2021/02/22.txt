Monday 22 Feb 2021
==================

I have the day off work.
What to accomplish with my time?

- [x] morning run â†’ painful 3km run on gravel road
- [x] reply to Jacob about rainbowphone
- [ ] I would like to get the rezd app working again
- [ ] Edit and publish video to youtube
- [ ] Looking forward to catching up with Jo today.
- [ ] Where am I going to stay in Christchurch? Not the YHA, somewhere different.

running
-------

Kaikoura beach is not great for barefoot running.

I'm considering cycling out to the Peninsula and trying the paths out there,
better views, no cars and perhaps less harsh on the soles.

Open from 0800 to 2000.
Can walk along the beach to get there, it's a 30 minute walk (one-way).

groceries for lunch:

- [x] spinach
- [x] carrots
- [x] brocolli
- [x] cucumber
- [x] capsicum
- [x] red onion
- [x] hummus

stir fry:

- [x] sweet corn
- [x] low-salt soy sauce
- [x] quinoa

fruits:

- [x] apples
- [x] bananas

other:

- [x] milk for tea would be heaven, look for vegan options
- [x] A toothbrush
- [x] waterproof plasters for my palms
- [ ] do NOT buy peanut butter, you've had enough

Grapevine Review
----------------

- a family, welcoming into the Grapevine family
- many events, cooking together, feasts, soccer games, kayaking to the rope swing
- bikes available to hire
- the managers are wonderful
- always something happening
- lots of amazing people

I was only planning to stay here for a week, but ended up staying here an extra week. 

Tucked away at the end of the industrial Park Terrace is my favourite hostel in NZ. 

In 2021 while many backpacker accomodation is quiet, the Grapevine is bustling with energy. 

Immediately welcomed into the family, where many stay for months

Packed full of joy, laughter and comradery

James' quiz night

Celebrating with pot luck dinners

Chips and dips night

Cooking in the kitchen, it may be small but it brings people together - great music and aromas, sharing food and stories
