===================

Up at 0630.
The guy in my room has a earthquake of a snore.

Working with Mel from the hostel lounge.
She is from Montreal and has been living in Wanaka.
Here in Kaikoura for a week (we both arrived on Saturday!).

Thinking about heading to Cafe Encoutnter this arvo.
0730 - 1500

Would also like to go for a run along the peninsula.

Rowan highly recommends the dolphin swim, I'm not keen to go by myself. I'd
rather share the experience with James or a friend.

Ellen is keen to visit Fat Eddie's in Christchurch.
