==================

NZ is back at Alert Level 2 -- there have been more cases in the community in
Auckland. 

Slowly copying video files from the GoPro camera on to my phone. I've found the
best way is to use Air Transfer on my phone and then connect to it over a
tethered USB connection - large file transfers are pretty quick.

However, I have run out of space on my phone - I will need to edit this video
in multiple stages as I can't fit all 12Gb of video on my phone at one time.

We are getting account locks when trying to login. This is almost certainly
because we are on a really old version of the app.

I need to make sure that the new version is production ready asap.

Grapevine Review
----------------

[5 stars]

The Grapevine Backpackers is one of my favourite places in New Zealand. Quietly
situated along the Ōpaoa River, this hostel is full to the brim with love, joy,
laughter and comradery.

Upon my arrival, I was immediately welcomed into the Grapevine family, a group
of some of the most loving, funny and talented young travellers I've ever met.
Initially, I had only planned to stay in Blenheim for a few days but found
myself having such a great time I didn't want to leave!

The managers here are wonderful, they'll make sure you have a comfortable stay
and will often organize fun events, including movie nights, quizzes and potluck
dinners. With so many people staying here, you'll never find yourself bored in
Blenheim.

While the kitchen may be on the smaller side, cooking here quickly brings
people together - everyone sharing stories, jokes, music and recipes. There is
a beautiful backyard where you can enjoy your meal with a stunning view of the
river.

For your convenience, there are free bikes available to get you quickly across
town - though make sure to take a lock with you or you may be walking back!  I
highly recommend making use of the free kayaks, on a hot day there is nothing
better than cruising east down the river and hurling yourself into the water
from the rope swing.

In short, I had a marvellous time at the Grapevine and I'm sure you will as
well.
