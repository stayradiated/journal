===================

I need to figure out if/how I am taking my sleeping bag with me.
The one I have isn't a great sleeping bag, it's 1.1kg and quite bulky.
I wonder if I should just buy a sleeping bag in Christchurch.

Quite a cheap bag:

I'd like to get something with down, that's good down to 0°.
