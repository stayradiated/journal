=====================

You dropped your black USB lightning cable in the room, make sure to pick that up.

0630 out of bed
0900 check-in to aroundtheworld
0915 working at saltworks
1000 dev meeting
1100 design meeting :: search + filter

around the world
----------------

Wait until 9am, then reception will open, pay for "Around The World" backpacker
accomodation. I will be only spending two more nights here, checking out on
Friday morning -- after which I will switch over to the Jailhouse, which is a
bit pricier but might not be so rough.

travel
------

I need to pick up a sleeping bag (and a tent?)

How am I getting out of Christchurch? Where am I going?
Today I should look at a map and figure all that out.

Could I travel to Dunedin on a bus with my bike?

https://www.intercity.co.nz/travel-info/baggage-and-terms/oversized-items

- remove wheels
- cover chain
- remove pedals (is this possible?)
 
todo:

- contact intercity, find out what I need to do to take a bike with me

It's a 6h 15m journey from Christchurch to Dunedin

bikepacking
-----------

what is the difference between bikepacking and touring?

touring
-------

chch → geraldine → omarama → queenstown

about 500km total

could be a fun trip

around again cycles
-------------------

open from 8:30am - 5:30pm

Worth seeing if I can get a derailleur for cheap + all the bits needed to
change gears.

Alternatively, buy a bike -- they also hire bikes out long term with a buy back
option.

trains
------

Dunedin does have trains, the Taieri Gorge train doesn't seem to be running though :(

Could do a day trip, leave early on saturday, visit the Okuti open day return
in the evening? That's a lot of cycling for one day…
