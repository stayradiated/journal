Climbing at Uprising this morning, just by myself.
Got the orange worm climb with the big death star hold figured out, still one

It would be good to practice writing notes about my key takeaways.

hasura intro
............

pair-programming with andria and priscilla today
stepping them through a report migration

1. start from `george/hasura-report-project-overview` branch
2. create a new branch for the report
3. make sure 
   - hasura is running (restart after switching branches)
   - database migrations have been applied (db:reset db:migrate db:seed)
4. check that
  - `yarn run graphql` is working
  - `yarn run relay` is working
5. rename report directory -- add the `_hasura` suffix
6. Edit `src/reports/ReportContainer` → import from new path
7. `yarn run relay:hasura` → should get errors
8. Edit `*Report.relay.tsx`
   - Viewer → users
   - users.permissions → remove subfields
   - id → id: global_id + db_id
   - hashid → delete
   - start_date → start_date: start_date_runn
   - end_date → end_date: end_date_runn
   - cost → cost_private
   - cost_padded → cost_padded_private
   - billable_minutes → sum_billable_minutes
   - nonbillable_minutes → sum_nonbillable_minutes
   - date → date_runn
   - assignments.is_placeholder → delete
   - schedule_totals_roles → (args: { client_date: $client_date })
   - add from_date:
     . actuals(where: { date_iso: { _gte: $from_date } }) {
     . assignments(where: { end_date_iso: { _gte: $from_date } }) {
9. Edit `*ReportContainer.tsx`
   - store → store/hasura
   - getClientDate
   - replace arguments
   - viewer → users(limit: 1)
   - ReportRender → ReportRender_hasura
   - remove all ReportRender props, apart from response/render
   - replace startDate with useState
10. `yarn run tsc`
   - import `Permissions` from permissions-helpers
   - viewer: { permissions, account } → 
      const permissions = viewer.permissions as Permissions
      const { clients, people } = viewer.account
   - add readonly tags type
   - know when to use LocalProjectReportData / ProjectReportData
   - hashid → hashids.projects.encode(db_id)
   - update tests:
     - add db_id to anything with an id
     - *_id → convert to number
   - Is ProjectPeriodAssumptions used?
