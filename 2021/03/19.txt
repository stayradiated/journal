bike shop
---------

I do love the simplicity of having a single speed bike, but damn gears are a
great invention.

Checking out of Around the World backpackers today.
I've got my all gear packed into my Aer bag and the Kathmandu hiking bag.

I need to get a bike rack and some panniers for my bike, so I can easily carry
a bunch of stuff with me.

Gods of Thunder
---------------

Who discovered electricity? Does lightning count?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thunder_gods
What a great wikipedia page. So many Gods!

shell
-----

Upgraded my version of python3-pip from v9 to v21!
Now I can install mycli locally -- which makes connecting to MySQL databases so
much more pleasant.
