Waking up in Fairlie!

Quite cold this morning, very grateful that I brought all my warm clothing
along with me now (jeans, jumper, socks, shoes, etc)

Packing up the tent, letting it dwy on the line.

Washing my clothes ($4). Bought detergent from 4-Square, left most of it at the
holiday park, brought along a little in a snaplock bag.

Working from a cafe on the corner, sitting upstairs on the balcony.

Lunch at the Fairlie Bakery, the pies are fantastic!

If the camembert cheese tastes bad, it's probably overripe and has too much
ammonia built up in it. This can be caused by tears in the packaging. It won't
make you sick (as long as the camembert uses pasteurized milk) but it isn't
very pleasant.
