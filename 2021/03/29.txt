==================

Waking up in Fairlie!

Quite cold this morning, very grateful that I brought all my warm clothing
along with me now (jeans, jumper, socks, shoes, etc)

Packing up the tent, letting it dwy on the line.

Washing my clothes ($4). Bought detergent from 4-Square, left most of it at the
holiday park, brought along a little in a snaplock bag.

Working from a cafe on the corner, sitting upstairs on the balcony.

Lunch at the Fairlie Bakery, the pies are fantastic!
