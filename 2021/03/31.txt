Wednesday 31 Mar 2021
=====================

Up at 5am. The two guys also staying in the dorm are up super early! They are
travelling to Queenstown.

The Greedy Cow cafe opens at 7:30am.

March has been an awfully bad month for my nutrition.

April:
- let's cut right back on sugar, what's the daily recommended intake?

camping
------

Thursday: May rain during the day, but it's not forecast to rain in the
evening., I would like to camp out at Lake Alexandrina. It's only 40 minutes
from Lake Tekapo and quite flat. I could leave some of my gear at the YHA
overnight as well. Clear skies, would be a good night for stargazing.

Friday night: raining. 

weather
-------

It's going to be a cold night on Friday!
Should be great weather next week.

Today:
Mostly cloudy. Isolated showers developing this morning, then rain from
afternoon.

Thursday:
Rain, possibly heavy in the north at first, clearing from the south in the
afternoon and becoming fine.

Friday:
Showers spreading from the south as westerlies change southerly, strong in
exposed places, all easing later.

todo
----

- [ ] wash my cycling clothes & towel
- [ ] edit/publish video pt. 2 for last weekend
- [x] explore Cowans Hill walkway on my bike
- [ ] visit the local bike shop and ask if I can use their bike stand -- I want
      to see if I can tune my rear derailleur a bit better.
- [ ] A small rear-view mirror for the bike is still a good idea.
- [x] Update RealMe identity verification, ugh

Game changer: YHA Tekapo have a "drying room" -- dry your clothes inside for free!
