==================

Waking up at Lake Alexandrina this morning, quite cloudy -- checked the sky a
couple times during the night but no stars visible.

Cycling back into Lake Tekapo, roads are still busy. Town is packed with
people stopping for coffee.

I am working today putting the time-off towards next weeks adventure.

accomodation
------------

Where are we going to stay tomorrow night? I should check the Mt Cook campsite
websites again. Only 7 spots left! Booked Saturday night at White Horse Hill
campsite.

Hmm, I was thinking of taking food with me, but having to carry food is a pain.

That said, there aren't many options from here to Mt. Cook.

:: Tasman Delta Cafe, Glentanner (4★) - good rest stop, probably very busy

I've got:

- 1 apple
- 1 mandarin
- ½ pack of nuts (with a handful of M&M's mixed in)
- 2 OSM bars
- packet of cocoa powder

I should buy:

- 2 apples
- 2 mandarins
- tub of hummus
- pack of wraps
- 1 capsicum, to chop up in the morning
