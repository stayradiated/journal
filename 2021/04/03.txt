====================

- Leaving Lake Tekapo YHA around 8am. Freezing cold, had to wear merino jumper,
  gloves and put socks on with my sandals!
- Following the Alps2Ocean (A2O) trail along the Tekapo Canal, beautiful views
  and very calm/quiet. Saw quite a few people fishing for salmon towards the
  end of the canal.
- The road drops very steeply right at the end, so I sped quickly down towards
  Lake Pukaki, following the road around the lake. At some point I saw an A2O
  sign taking me off the road and along a dirt path on the foreshore -- less
  steep and no car traffic!
- Followed the path to the Mt. Cook Alpine Salmon Shop, from there I had to
  cycle along SH8 until the turn-off towards Mt. Cook. It was around noon and
  the traffic had quieted down, I saw more people coming the other way.
- Stopping for lunch at the Pukaki View Pt (W46P+98), having vegetable/tuna
  wraps, very filling.
- Continuing on, winds fairly calm until the final 20km when they really picked
  up and progress was slow and exhausting. I reached Mt. Cook village around
  4pm, hoping to rest at the cafe there, but it was closed until 5pm, so I sat
  around the back and took in the view (along with water and a cookie!).
- Final 2.5km to get to the campground took ages with the head winds, but
  eventually made it! Very busy, but lots of space for tents. Got set up,
  walked around a bit, didn't feel like doing the Hooker Valley track -- will
  try running it tomorrow morning.
- Had dinner in the shelter, it was too windy outside to prepare wraps.
- Met Judith, an older woman who had trouble sleeping on a crackly camping
  mattress who was desperate for sleep - she comfortable slept on the seats in
  the shelter while everyone else cooked and chatted.
- Continued editing video for Pt. 2 of the Cass-Lagoon hiking adventure.
- Video chatting parents, James paved the cement path flat and then Murphy
  walked straight through it!
- Video chatting Jo, she is back at her parents place for a bit, having a chill
  weekend. Today she is taking her family out on Excalibur for a day trip to
  Plymouth.
- In bed at 9pm, hoping to get some sleep with all this wind!
