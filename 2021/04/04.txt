==================

Waking up at White Horse Hill campground.
Very windy, didn't sleep very well - the whole tent was shaking back and worth
with the wind.

Apparently someone's tent flew off in the morning!

Richard offered me a ride, but then he felt the winds had calmed down and
decided to go and walk the Mueller Hut track instead.

I started cycling towards Twizel, with ferociously strong tail-winds...

They had camped at Lake Pukaki overnight, visiting Mt. Cook this morning. They
highly recommend the Blue Lakes walking tracks (next time!). One of them had
just returned from London recently, they had both just started on a a month
long trip around the South Island.

They dropped me off at the corner of the Lake Pukaki and SH8. I cycled the rest
of the way to Twizel, deathly aware of the strong wind and traffic.

I made it to Twizel without incident and stopped at Shawty's cafe for lunch
(mum's recommendation!). Poached Eggs, belgium slice and coffee -- I feel much
better now.

Going to have a quiet Sunday afternoon in Twizel before heading to a campsite
just north of here, I should be able to get there without going on the highway
as well.

Note: daylight savings took affect today, 2pm becomes 3pm.
Sunset at Twizel is now at 6:24pm.

Gave the Twizel backpackers a call, they have 2 free beds! I reserved one, they
said turn up at 3pm. It's going to be great to have a shower!

Sat in the Twizel town square, sewing the Tekapo patch to my bag. It's great to
just chill for a bit.

Had a toasted Hot Cross Bun at the local bakery.

Checked into the backpackers, in a 4-bed dorm. Snagged the bottom bunk,
unloaded my panniers and locked my bike out the front - I still worry someone
is going to steal it… I should just buy a decent lock.

Ordered a vegetable curry and naan from the Fishtail curry store, absolutely
delicious. Shout-out to the dude from Lake Tekapo YHA reception who recommended
it to me.

Ordered a nice towel for Jo's birthday, apparently these Hammam towels are
super soft, absorbent and great for travel.

Not sure what I am going to do tomorrow, probably another chill day. Fingers
crossed it's not as windy…
