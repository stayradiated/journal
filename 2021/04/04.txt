==================

Waking up at White Horse Hill campground.
Very windy, didn't sleep very well - the whole tent was shaking back and worth
with the wind.

Apparently someone's tent flew off in the morning!

Richard offered me a ride, but then he felt the winds had calmed down and
decided to go and walk the Mueller Hut track instead.

I started cycling towards Twizel, with ferocious tail-winds,

They had camped at Lake Pukaki overnight, visiting Mt. Cook this morning. They
highly recommend the Blue Lakes walking tracks (next time!). One of them had
just returned from London recently, they had both just started on a a month
long trip around the South Island.

They dropped me off at the corner of the Lake Pukaki and SH8. I cycled the rest
of the way to Twizel, deathly aware of the strong wind and traffic.

I made it to Twizel without incident and stopped at Shawty's cafe for lunch
(mum's recommendation!).
