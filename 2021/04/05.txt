==================

- Had a great idea this morning to contact the local cycle touring company in
  Twizel and ask if they can transport my bags to Omarama -- they can! It's not
  cheap at $15 per bag, but worth it!
- I quickly cycle back to the lodge, pack up my stuff, say goodbye to Merxe and
  Antoine, and then quickly cycle back to Twizel Cycle Journeys. They take my
  bags, I contact the Top 10 Holiday Park in Omarama, book a spot for my tent
  and let them know my bags will be arriving.
- I stop by the Twizel 4-Square, pick up some chocolate, bliss balls and a can
  of pringles.
- Start my trip by cycling west out of Twizel, very strong headwinds, but I
  power on through, keeping my head down, overtaking several groups of
  cyclists.
- The route follows the canal, which is quite nice, very little road traffic,
  but today with the strong winds it's quite difficult cycling -- the wind
  swirls around and each turn it changes between a tail wind or head wind --
  some parts are tough others are easy.
- Arriving at Lake Ohau I meet Andrew, a guy in his 50's with an awesome
  bikepacking setup: all the best bags, carbon fibre forks, wide range of gears
  in his casette, a generator in the front wheel that provides USB charging,
  handlebars that support multiple arm positions, tubeless tires, brooks seat,
  bike computer and little bags for snacks that can be open and closed with one
  hand. Andrew is also staying at the Omarama Top 10 Holiday Park tonight.
- Cycling around Lake Ohau is quite windy, but manageable with the shrubs
  providing some cover, I overtake several groups of cyclists in my effort to
  get this part of the track down as soon as possible.
- The worst part of the day is cycling along the road to Lake Ohau Lodge, the
  winds are insanely strong. I perservere and eventually make it to the Lodge
  where I enjoy a coffee and lake view. It's too windy to do much outside, but
  I enjoy the rest stop.
- Carrying on the A2O track takes me up a rocky mountain biking path, which
  peaks 11.5km in at an elevation of 900m. The strong winds now generally work
  in my favour, helping me up the steep hills. At the highest point I stop for
  some pringles and photos.
- The descent is fast, rough and technical, my bike (which I've officially
  named Brian) handles it better than I expected. Long stretches of the track
  are nothing but large loose rocks.
- From the Historic Woolshed things get much better, it's a smooth gravel road
  with strong tail winds -- I get up to 50km/h without much effort, weary of
  going to fast and skidding out on the gravel.
- I overtake a group, but stop to chat about how good the tail winds are. I
  carry on to Omarama, which has a short stretch on the highway. I bump into
  Andrew at the cafe and we grab a hot drink together, chatting about cycling
  and other outdoor adventures for a good hour.
- We cycle to the Top 10, check-in (my bags made it!) and set up our tents. I
  have a good shower, get dressed in my jeans and shoes and then head out to
  the supermarket for some groceries.
- The Top 10 has an odd system in the kitchen, it's a $10 deposit to get access
  to plates and cutlery… better than nothing at all! I have a healthy dinner,
  chat with Andrew some more about cycling around NZ and then scoff some
  choc-chip biscuits while planning out my Tuesday.
