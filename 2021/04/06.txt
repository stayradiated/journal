===================

Cycling up Lindis Pass today, this is going to be a killer… At least the winds
have died down, I just have to cycle for 3 hours and the gradients are too bad…

Andrew is heading off to Kurow today.

Apparently schools have a teacher-only day today, so that's why there is a bit
more traffic around then I was expecting.
Should calm down midday, which is when I will set off for Lindis Pass.

Having an early lunch at the Wrinkly Rams cafe.

I've let mum know that there isn't any cell reception at tonights campground,
so she won't panic if she hasn't heard from me.
