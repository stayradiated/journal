====================

I have been using bikeroll.net to plan my trips, it's great for visualizing the terrain.

Will probably stay at Cromwell Backpackers, dorm rooms are $34 -- but it will
be nice to stay inside, I don't have to worry about packing up the tent
tomorrow morning.

Having brunch at Federal Diner, I remember this cafe from my earlier trip to
Wanaka, it hasn't changed much at all. Wanaka is such a beautiful town.

Having dinner sitting at the tables outside Nichol's cafe, dipping vegetables
in hummus, cheese and crackers, with an apple and chocolate for desert.
