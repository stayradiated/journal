==================

Last day of the trip! It's not going to be an easy win though.

Stopping for coffee at Nichol's Garden Centre & Cafe

Rowan recommends visiting Mt Sunday. He climbed Mt. Potts one day, ran out of
water and had to walk back in the dark with a headlight, but he enjoyed it.

Got to get to Rowan's place.

Planning to go via Arrowtown, the roads should be quieter and it's a bit flatter.

:: Cromwell → Arrowtown [47km] <766m/558m> (2h 35m)
// first 15km - mostly flat
//  next 15km - a bakers dozen of steep hills to climb over
//       38km - climbing over the Kawarau River
