====================

Flying to Auckland today! It's an awfully rainy day in Queenstown, so I don't
regret not being here for the weekend.

It's nice having a break from cycling, I didn't have to worry about making sure
more my bike lights were charged last night.

I'd like to grab lunch at Xi'an foodbar if possible -- just be really careful
not to spill anything on my clothes! I should check-in with Ivan and see what
his plans are.

I am staying at the Auckland YHA, I haven't been here before, it looks quite
decent.

future travels
--------------

I would like to get to Stewart Island, the sooner the better. Cycling there
could be possible, just going to need some warm gear.

When is the best time to stay at Mueller Hut? I should ask Ivan.

I am thinking about staying in Christchurch over winter, going
skiing/snowboarding with Ivan, climbing with Pete, etc.

brian the bike
--------------

I would like to get Brian checked up while I am in Queenstown, I would like to
know if it's worth replacing the tires (the rear tire is quite worn). I would
also like to get some smaller front panniers so I can distribute the weight
across the bike, instead of just having it at the back. A clip on/off system
would also be useful, it's currently quite tricky to take the panniers on and
off with the straps.

ChaeJin + Soomin Wedding Celebration
------------------------------------

Scheduled for 1730, what time should I arrive, early or late?  Could head over
to Devonport earlier and then hang around in the library. Oh the library shuts
at 1700…

Getting there from YHA:
- catch 105 bus down queen street.
- walk to ferry terminal
- catch ferry to Devonport (either 5pm or 5:30pm)
- either walk to McHughs (20min) or catch bus (9min)
