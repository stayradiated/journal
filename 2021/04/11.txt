Sunday 11 Apr 2021
==================

Feeling tired and a little out of sorts. Probably eating too much food last
night and a lack of sleep. Also, since completing my short term goal of getting
to Queenstown I no longer have a driving force.

Reading the John Hellemans "A Biker's Tale" -- a short book about his 2018 trip
on the Tour Aotearoa.
