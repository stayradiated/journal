==================

Back to work today!

Automated doors that swing in/out feel more futuristic than automatic doors
that slide left/right.

Feeling quite tired this afternoon, I have been working from quite a few
different places. Tried working from the Auckland Public Library, but they are
having construction issues and are closed this week.

Planning to have a few vegetables with hummus for dinner.

wifi

Finally figured out what was up with my laptop not working on the YHA networks.

Debugged on the Arch Linux host, using the `ip route` command which listed a
bunch of extra IP addresses.

I went through and deleted each one, e.g. `sudo ip route del 172.27.0.0/16`

When listing all the networks:

```
[admin@carbon ~]$ ip route
default via 172.20.0.1 dev wlp2s0 proto dhcp src 172.20.15.13 metric 3003
172.20.0.0/20 dev wlp2s0 proto dhcp scope link src 172.20.15.13 metric 3003
```

Now I can visit neverssl.com and get redirected to the reivernet portal
correctly!

guitars

I want to take a guitar with me travelling, but surely this conflicts with cycling?

Sounds difficult.

Alternatively, there are expensive travel guitars:

But these are not recommended for beginners…

There is such a thing as a "Guitarlele", it's a 6 string ukelele. Could be
something to look at?

I could go and visit the Rockshop tomorrow (they are open from 9am).

Need to keep in mind that I have a perfectly good guitar and case back in
Rotorua, along with a great little ukelele.

Now I'm thinking about getting a Harmonica, much smaller, sounds pretty cool,
not sure if I have the guts to practice it near within earshot of anyone else.
