===================

I kind of want to buy a harmonica now. It seems like the best travel
instrument. → update, I now own a harmonica! Hohner Silverstar.

I also want to get some more bags for my bike, I'm not sure if I want to get
front panniers or a handlebar bag.

I can't believe how long these Apple Earpods have lasted me, I feel like they
should have broken by now.

They have Best Ugly Bagels at the Auckland Domestic Airport, might have to try
them for lunch.

Alan Watts is the philosopher with the great voice that keeps getting sampled
and putting into songs. Looking at reading the "The Way of Zen" but it's not
available on Amazon until July? That's odd.

Feeling quite hungry, can't wait to eat something at midday. → Feel like I've
eaten too much, I need to find a way to be better at self moderation.

Chrome has a built in remote desktop: https://remotedesktop.google.com/
Seems like a brilliant alternative to TeamViewer

Travelling, by bike, bus or plane, really wears me out. Looking forward to an
early night and a quite sleep.
