====================

Can we poll the NZTA website for driver licence appointment times?
Probably, will need to get around their captcha.



hunger
------

Trying to feel more in control over what I eat. I've been awful at eating too
much food lately.

Just had a filling lunch at The Exchange cafe in Queenstown, feel like I don't
need to eat anything until dinner.

I also want to be strict in the evenings - set a deadline, 8pm, and don't
consume any calories after that. (hot cocoa or tea is fine though)

Reading about Tim's travel adventures has got me feeling itchy feet to get out
in the world and travelling around, meeting exciting people who do crazy things.

> 
> Taking a commuter boat for three days down the Amazon from Belem to Manaus
> (Northern Brazil), sleeping in a mess of hammocks and looking out at the
> little river communities along the way.
> 
> Riding the Trans-Siberian railway from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk, looking out the
> window, making friends with passengers, and seeing how the political views
> changed the further east we got (more on that trip here).
> 
> Driving around desolate parts of Utah national parks, and sleeping every
> night outside the car on the edge of a canyon and waking up to the best view
> ever.
> 
> Staying with a family who lives in a yurt on the edge of the alpine Lake
> Song-Kul in Kyrgyzstan, spending the day in silence tagging along with the
> non-English-speaking shepherd as he did his thing with the sheep up on the
> mountain, and watching their weekly horse race.
> 
> Driving around Southern Italy and stopping for lunch in small walled villages
> on the tops of hills and waving to window nonnas.
> 
> The Yangon New Year’s Water Festival in Myanmar. Good god. We got invited
> onto the back of a truck with a bunch of locals, and the truck proceeded to
> drive around the city for five hours while we got absolutely wrecked by power
> hoses.
> 
> Driving from Dubai to Southern UAE and camping out on the softest dunes ever.
> 
> Going to Gen Yamamoto’s bar in Tokyo for six of the fanciest little cocktails
> imaginable (he’s kind of the Jiro of cocktails) over two amazing hours.8 Also
> just the entire country of Japan in general.
> 
> Taking a boat two hours from a small Greenlandic town to a 46-person village
> and doing a stay with the town grandmother. More on that trip here.

> Stewart Island’s weather is very changeable and difficult to predict. Strong
> winds, hail and heavy rain can occur at any time of the year. Check the
> Rakiura National Park weather forecast – NIWA website (external site). You
> should come equipped for the very worst weather conditions. Remember,
> exposure and hypothermia can affect anyone and can kill.

> Huts on the Rakiura Track don't have gas cooking facilities, lighting or
> toilet paper.

great resouce:

[[ https://www.walkmyworld.com/posts/everything-you-need-to-know-to-hike-the-rakiura-track ]]

Water purification tablets - The water on the Rakiura is clean and good to drink without purifying.
Toilet paper - All huts and toilets on the track provide this.

- just get used to cold meals

> We'd suggest getting the local taxi to the start of the track (at the time of
> writing it cost $30 for the car, so can be as little as $7.50 each for four
> people). Lee Bay is a good 6km away from the centre of Oban and there's
> really no point in walking along concrete roads through a village for 6km
> before the track has even started!

- 2154ms vs 1820ms

- Mini Charts, I think we could do this better than a tiny area chart. I would
  like to put together a prototype and get feedback from people.



- deploy-to-heroku-action: why is hasura not starting up properly on a fresh
  PR? Seems like the service is spinning up before we finish the migrations.
