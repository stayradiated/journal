Brendo's birthday!

PoolsideFM launched a sunscreen and I just love their artwork.

Borrowed 'The 99% Invisible City' book the Queenstown Library -- they have a
short stay visitors card, which is awesome! I am going to donate my copy of "A
Biker's Tale" to this library.

I should pick up a couple of donuts from Ferg Bakery on my way back to Rowan's.

walks
-----

Seems silly to cycle all the way to invercargill just to do the Rakiura track
when there are plenty of great walks around Queenstown.

Isn't the Routeburn a thing? I should look at doing that instead.
Oh, it's 70km from Queenstown and the Mackenzie Hut is booked up.

Lilliput Libraries
------------------

Turns out there are thousands of these around the country.

I am going to donate my copy of "A Biker's Tale" -- it was a good read and I
enjoyed the book, but I don't want to carry it around with me.

I think I will write my name in the front cover and then leave it at
https://catalystnz.org/lilliput-library/watts-road/

Actually, the Queenstown Library is nicer and doesn't have a copy of it.
