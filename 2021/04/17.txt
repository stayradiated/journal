Keen to go for a pre-lunch run around Queenstown this morning

git

lots to learn from here:

TIL that you can reference a git commit by it's message with ':/message'

1. make sure all local repos are up to date

    » for d in */; do pushd $d; pwd; gfr; popd; done

2. commit changes to resnapchat 

starting docker android:

» docker run --privileged -d -p 6080:6080 -p 5554:5554 -p 5555:5555 --name android-container budtmo/docker-android-x86-11.0
» dapk get --arch arm -o /tmp/snapchat_10.72.5.0.apk --snapchat-version 10.72.5.0
» adb install /tmp/snapchat_10.72.5.0.apk

?. why are we getting 504 errors from polling lazoapi -- we should be able to
avoid those.

> Reason: Error: Could not decrypt password for fiddleydpotatos. Value: "qv8Pi0wqaDNqmDrtC2WsYg==". Error: Error: error:06065064:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:bad decrypt

but why is the cache upload not working? probably an API thing
