==================

Weather is not looking good for this weekendâ€¦
Could take time off work and leave earlier?
Or stay in Queenstown for a little longer (at a hostel) and leave later?

Sunset is around 18:00, that gives me 5 hours of cycling time if I catch the
noon Earnslaw. Plenty of time to travel 50km.
