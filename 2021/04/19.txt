==================

Weather is not looking good for this weekend…
Could take time off work and leave earlier?
Or stay in Queenstown for a little longer (at a hostel) and leave later?

Sunset is around 18:00, that gives me 5 hours of cycling time if I catch the
noon Earnslaw. Plenty of time to travel 50km.

My shoes are in the country, when they arrive at home I will need mum to
forward them to the South Island. Or I could fly back to Rotorua?

standup: me, ruth

Research & Development day at Runn.

I would like to experiment with Feature Flags.

- Could add a table to Hasura that we can query.
- Able to toggle it on for different users.

tables: features + features_users

This would be a Good thing to explore subscriptions with.

https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/index.html

> You can turn any query into a subscription by simply replacing query with
> subscription as the operation type.

- [ ] help priscilla with createRoleForm mutation + hasura
