=====================

James has his restricted license test today (1015).

Still planning to cycle out of Queenstown on Friday.
Forecast says there might be a little rain, but nothing too serious.
Storms are heading this way soon though… 
If weather is really bad, I could stop at Kingston for the night, otherwise I
would like to make it to Lumsden.  It will cost $90 for a bed at a fancy hotel.
Or could stay at the campground, unless it's going to be cold _and_ wet?

Might put off the kiwicoin withdrawal form until I get to Invercargill.

Invercargill: We have a free Justice of the Peace (JP) Service on Saturday
morning 10am – 12 noon except at Easter Christmas and public holidays.
