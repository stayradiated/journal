==================

Taking today off work to cycle to Invercargill.

Codecov got hacked! I found out because Wunderflats sent me an email warning
that I had used Codecov.

cycling

Queenstown â†’ Lumsden

stopping at:

- frankton, to check if Evo cycles have a bike mirror (out of stock)
- kingston, margharita pizza (loaded with cheese) for lunch at the kingston flyer
- garston, grabbing a belgium slice at The Bomb coffee cart

distance: 115.64km
moving time: 5:08:33
elevation: 933m
avg speed: 22.5km/h
max speed: 56.5km/h

Far more elevation gain than I had expected, I thought it was going to be more
downhill! The first half of the ride was great, following the edge of Lake
Wakitpu around the base of the Remarkables. The last hour was tough, it started
it raining a little and the temperature had dropped quite a bit.

I'm staying at the Lumsden Hotel -- it's $90 for a room, but it's clean, warm
and I am not in the mood for camping this evening.

For dinner I bought a scoop of chips from the local chippie and walked around
Lumsden in the dark eating them out of the packet and dipping them in hummus.

Right now, I'm siting in the bar at the hotel. I just finished a small glass of
pilsner, which was only $4! Feeling quite tired, I think I'll call the family
and then go to sleep.

It's _only_ 80km to Invercargill tomorrow, but there is only decent hill to get
over and the rest is smooth downhill, which should be a dream!

Thinking of leaving around 9:30am again tomorrow, forecast is for some light
showers in the afternoon, so I should be good. I'm not expecting much traffic
either, I imagine most people are heading out of Invercargill instead of
towards it!
