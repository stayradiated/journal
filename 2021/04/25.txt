Sunday 25 Apr 2021
==================

This morning in Invercargill: the ANZAC day dawn service.
Lots of people, lots of rain.
Wearing my jeans, shoes and red raincoat.
WW1-era canon was used.
Old man having technical difficulties with the loudspeaker, warning us that at
6:59am the cannon would fire and we should block our ears for health and
safety. Keeps talking, suddenly cannon goes off when no one expected it to, it
was 6:59am. Canon goes off again at 7am, again no when knew to expect it.
Standing in the rain for 40 minutes. Canon goes off 4 more times, no warning
each time.

Feeling hungry.  The Auction House case is open today (but not tomorrow).
Thinking about walking over there and grabbing a morning coffee.
Updated: I did just that.

Southern Farmers Market is from 1300 - 1700 today.
Might be a good place to get lunch.

Just as I was about to leave The Auction House I got a call from Jo. It was
nearly 1am in the UK and I figured she had pocket-dialed me. The call didn't
connect properly, so I started to write out a message asking if the call was
intentional, when I received a message from her:

> Sorry, just thought I'd call on the off chance you weren't busy doing
> something cool to congratulate you on your arrival to Invercargill

I called Jo over video and we chatted while I walked around the cold windy
streets of Invercargill. The internet here is surprisingly awful and the
connection kept dropping out. Jo had a good day out teaching two students how
to sail, it was remarkably wavy - one student suffered sea-sickness - but they
both enjoyed it and will be back tomorrow for part 2. This week she is heading
off to sail around the UK on Pelican.

cacoa powder
------------

Picked up a 250g packet of "Cacao Powder" -- seems like a better version of the
cocoa powder that I've been enjoying -- similar taste but with more nutrients.

  * â†³ montane terra pants look quite versatile
    + â†³ lots of people recommend them

    + â†³ not good for rain, not very durable

swanndri
--------

> designed by William Broome (1873â€“1942)

> Since he registered Swanndri as a trademark on 23 December 1913, it has
> become an iconic New Zealand garment, and the term "swanny" has, to some
> extent at least, become a genericised trademark for heavy bush shirts within
> New Zealand. 

> The item was widely worn by farmers, but in recent years its popularity has
> spread and it has become something of a fashion item. 

> Swanndri has been outsourcing its production to China since 2005.

montane terra pants
-------------------

> Montaneâ€™s Terra Pants are considered technical pants because theyâ€™re designed
> for the rigors of climbing, scrambling and mountain hiking where you need
> extra durability, water and wind resistance, and an active cut for enhanced
> maneuverability. 

> Whatever, you do, make sure to get them in black, all black.
