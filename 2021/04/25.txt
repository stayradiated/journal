Sunday 25 Apr 2021
==================

This morning in Invercargill: the ANZAC day dawn service.
Lots of people, lots of rain.
Wearing my jeans, shoes and red raincoat.
WW1-era canon was used.
Old man having technical difficulties with the loudspeaker, warning us that at
6:59am the cannon would fire and we should block our ears for health and
safety. Keeps talking, suddenly cannon goes off when no one expected it to, it
was 6:59am. Canon goes off again at 7am, again no when knew to expect it.
Standing in the rain for 40 minutes. Canon goes off 4 more times, no warning
each time.

Feeling hungry.  The Auction House case is open today (but not tomorrow).
Thinking about walking over there and grabbing a morning coffee.
Updated: I did just that.

Southern Farmers Market is from 1300 - 1700 today.
Might be a good place to get lunch.
Updated: it's hailing outside, not a great day for cycling!

Just as I was about to leave The Auction House I got a call from Jo. It was
nearly 1am in the UK and I figured she had pocket-dialed me. The call didn't
connect properly, so I started to write out a message asking if the call was
intentional, when I received a message from her:

> Sorry, just thought I'd call on the off chance you weren't busy doing
> something cool to congratulate you on your arrival to Invercargill

I called Jo over video and we chatted while I walked around the cold windy
streets of Invercargill. The internet here is surprisingly awful and the
connection kept dropping out. Jo had a good day out teaching two students how
to sail, it was remarkably wavy - one student suffered sea-sickness - but they
both enjoyed it and will be back tomorrow for part 2. This week she is heading
off to sail around the UK on Pelican.

I should tell Jo about my plan to book a flight to London for September.

cacoa powder

Picked up a 250g packet of "Cacao Powder" -- seems like a better version of the
cocoa powder that I've been enjoying -- similar taste but with more nutrients.

swanndri
--------

> designed by William Broome (1873â€“1942)

> Since he registered Swanndri as a trademark on 23 December 1913, it has
> become an iconic New Zealand garment, and the term "swanny" has, to some
> extent at least, become a genericised trademark for heavy bush shirts within
> New Zealand. 

> The item was widely worn by farmers, but in recent years its popularity has
> spread and it has become something of a fashion item. 

> Swanndri has been outsourcing its production to China since 2005.

montane terra pants
-------------------

> Montaneâ€™s Terra Pants are considered technical pants because theyâ€™re designed
> for the rigors of climbing, scrambling and mountain hiking where you need
> extra durability, water and wind resistance, and an active cut for enhanced
> maneuverability. 

> Whatever, you do, make sure to get them in black, all black.

Both the routebourn and the kepler sound amazing.

Could work tomorrow, pocket the leave and take friday off again?
Or work on mishguru tomorrow? I need to sort out the caching issue.
