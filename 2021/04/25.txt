==================

This morning in Invercargill: the ANZAC day dawn service.
Lots of people, lots of rain.

Wearing my jeans, shoes and red raincoat.

WW1-era canon was used.

Feeling hungry.
The Auction House case is open today (but not tomorrow).

Thinking about walking over there and grabbing a morning coffee.

Southern Farmers Market is from 1300 - 1700 today.
Might be a good place to get lunch.

clothing
--------

- a lightweight merino beanie would be good
- are quick drying travel jeans a thing? 
  * â†³ bluffworks "departure" travel jeans ($45 shipping ðŸ˜¢)
    + â†³ $170NZD! Surely there are cheaper options.
  * â†³ montane terra pants look quite versatile
    + â†³ lots of people recommend them
  * â†³ icebreaker have the "briar" and "persist" pants, worth trying on
    + â†³ not good for rain, not very durable

swanndri
--------

> designed by William Broome (1873â€“1942)

> Since he registered Swanndri as a trademark on 23 December 1913, it has
> become an iconic New Zealand garment, and the term "swanny" has, to some
> extent at least, become a genericised trademark for heavy bush shirts within
> New Zealand. 

> The item was widely worn by farmers, but in recent years its popularity has
> spread and it has become something of a fashion item. 

> Swanndri has been outsourcing its production to China since 2005.

montane terra pants
-------------------

> Montaneâ€™s Terra Pants are considered technical pants because theyâ€™re designed
> for the rigors of climbing, scrambling and mountain hiking where you need
> extra durability, water and wind resistance, and an active cut for enhanced
> maneuverability. 

> Whatever, you do, make sure to get them in black, all black.
