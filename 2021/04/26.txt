==================

Am I working today? Who knows.

The Auction House is closed today, but Toasted is open. I think I would like to
try one of their bagels.

I have ordered a "razor comb" -- this is the analogue beard trimmer I have been
looking for -- a comb combined with a DE razor blade. Lightweight, don't even
need to charge it.

rakiura
--------

- [ ] Walker’s wool? → try out the shoes first
- [ ] packable day pack? → could just hike with my aer backpack

- Need to wait for shoes to arrive, if they are shipped on tuesday they might
  not arrive until saturday! I will need to play it by ear.

wish list
---------

- tortuga setout packable day pack (as recommended by neverendingvoyage)
  ↳ I don't really need this - my kånken is already a great daypack
- usb chargeable beard trimmer
