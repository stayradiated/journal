Washing/drying my clothes this morning. Cost $9, but worth it to have clean
underwear. I am thinking about switching to merino underwear, but not being
able to tumble dry it seems like a big disadvantage? I guess merino dries a lot
quicker than cotton.

Icebreaker also wants $60 for a single pair! Thunderpants are another option,
I've tried them in the past but I should have gone a size or two larger.

The socks I bought at the merino outlet store in Christchurch have been
fantastic, next time I am in christchurch I will have another look in there.

Need to save away nearly $4k to pay my taxes! I've set up a new "Long Term"
account in TSB so I slowly pay that back without having to change my investment
strategy.

Found a learners drivers license and kiwibank visa card on the footpath. I
picked it up and handed it into the local police station.
