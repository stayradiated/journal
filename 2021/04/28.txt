would be ok to leave my bike there for a week.

Update: shoes just arrived this morning! PostHaste overnight isn't joking!

> It's neither too long or too steep if done over three days.

day 1:
undulating walk, with small climbs and descents
8.86km ∙ 331m ∙ easy

day 2:
steep start and two steepish hills to climb, otherwise flat.
one section of mud to walk through. the hardest day.
13.98km ∙ 650m ∙ moderate

day 3:
undulating walk, but mainly flat. one patch of mud to walk through.
11.32km ∙ 400m ∙ easy

I will need to figure out if I have everything I need for a 3 day hike. I am
planning to take my aer backpack. How well does my sleeping bag fit in that? I
have the rain cover, which is very handy.

Could be related to the cli-ext plugin?

https://github.com/hasura/cli-plugins-index/blob/master/plugins/cli-ext/v1.3.3/manifest.yaml
Maybe we could bundle this within the docker image?
