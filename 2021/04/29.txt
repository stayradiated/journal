=====================

🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️
A mostly cloudy day with occasional drizzle, more persistent from evening.
Westerlies, fresh at times.

travels
-------

I'm on Rakiura (Stewart Island)! It's raining and I'm sleeping in my tent
tonight. Great time to learn how to set up a tent in the rain!

Update: I checked into the Stewart Island Backpackers and thank heavens they
have a spare bed for me inside! No camping in the rain for this boy!  I still
have my tent though, so maybe I'll do some camping next week if it's drier?
I'm sharing the room with two women.

tomorrow
--------

I am not working tomorrow.
I will be walking to Port William hut.
If I walk from here to Lee Bay (instead of getting a taxi) it will be 13.0km
and take around 3 hours. So plenty of time.

I could check-out of here tomorrow morning at 10am, walk to the hut and be there by 1pm!
So it's really not a long walk. I plan to take it easy and take lots of photos.

I will not be taking my laptop with me. But I will have my phone which I can
take notes on.

I haven't got too much to do tomorrow morning.
It's mainly just a matter of how much food I can fit in my bag. I will likely
need to chop up the broccoli and capsicum into small chunks.

I'm pretty confident this is going to be a great weekend.

Is there anything I can do this evening to help prepare? I can't think of
anything.

Forecast
--------

metvuw looks very promising, not a drop of rain until Monday!

Friday: (14/8°c) Period of morning rain, then isolated showers and increasing
fine breaks. Fresh southwesterlies, strong at times about the coast and Stewart
Island, easing in the evening.

Saturday: (14/10°c) Areas of morning cloud, then fine, but remaining partly
cloudy about the coast. Westerlies, becoming strong about the coast and Stewart
Island in the evening.

Sunday: (16/11°c) Mostly cloudy. A few showers about the coast and Stewart
Island, clearing later. Brisk westerlies easing late.

- [ ] look at adding a read-only user to hasura

Giving a demo to the team about how to set up a mutation action with Hasura.

You could write a blog post about this…

For example: how to create a note.
Easy, could show how to implement custom logic.
Add caveat that this is something we could also do with Hasura actions.

1. create endpoint in ruby
2. create action in hasura
3. test action.
