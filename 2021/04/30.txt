=======================


Walking to Port William hut today.

Saying goodbye to room mates to Emma & Hannah - two british women travelling around NZ. 

Walking out from Oban to Lee Bay. Could have taken the taxi but it's $30 and I have plenty of time. A slight drizzle of rain around 0930 but it passes soon. 

Crossing Little River beach at low tide. I really like the coastal sections of this track, the sea views are stunning. 

Walking through the forest, seeing a few other trampers but had the plqce to myself for the most part. 

Occasional cell reception. Usually better at the beach. 

Saw keruru, piwakaka and deer. 

Arrived at Port William hut around 1pm. I was the first tramper here. They are working hard to protect the hut against bed bugs, so we have been asked to keep our packs outside. 

I spent the afternoon listening to podcasts and reading. Feeling quite tired. Wraps, hummus, tuna and veggies for dinner.

Going out looking for kiwi around 1915. Will probably have head off to bed around 2000.

A group of three japanese woman invited me to play Monopoly Deal with them - I hadn't played it before, but it is a quick game to learn. We plauwd two rounds, I won the second after getting a hotel on mayfair and then charging everyone 15M in rent!

Went out looking for kiwis, but very quiet - no sound of any bords at all. 

The hut wardens (twp older women) are very friendly, they are staying in here for ten days. They like to keep the hut toasty. 

Got my ticket checked at 7pm. Nice to know that the tickets do get checked.

I think I'd like to get the ferry, just for the experience. It would be near to visit bluff as well.  

Would need to hitch-hike into invercargill. Only 20 minute drive.
