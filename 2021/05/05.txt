razor comb
----------

I tried out my razor comb this morning. It's not particularly high quality, but
it cuts well enough. I would like to try it with decent Feather blades. It
seems like it will be decent for keeping my beard from being too scruffy,
though I'm not sure how good it will be for my lower neck.  It's certainly
ultra-light and doesn't take up much space in bag, so it's great for travel.

travel
------

Could cycle to Curio Bay this Friday? How crazy would that be?

I've attached the Robo-Kiwi handlebar bag to my bag. It was a little trickier
than I expected to attach, but it's quite secure. I hope the front brake cable
won't be in the way. I will try putting carrying some gear in it tomorrow. Not
quite sure what I'll put in the front bag.
