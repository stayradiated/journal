Mainly fine, some morning cloud. Light winds.

travel
-------

Cycling to Curio Bay today.
Weather should be good for today & tomorrow.
Looking at some decent rain on Sunday.

Left at 9:30am from Southern Comfort backpackers.

I had lunch at Fortrose Cafe - a slice of bacon and egg pie ($8) and a cinnamon
pretzel ($5).

I visited the Waipapa Point Lighthouse and enjoyed the view.

Arrived at Curio Bay at just after 4pm. [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curio_Bay ]]

Staying at the Curioscape Campground ($30 for a tent site!).

It is a beautiful area though, near the remains of a petrified forest.

I met a couple from Thailand with a gigantic camera, waiting to photograph the
Hoiho (yellow-eyed penguins). I waited with them, but left at 6pm.
