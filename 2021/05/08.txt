tomorrow
--------

- could try and go all the way to Dunedin?
- I would like to visit Nugget Point, but it is 10km in the wrong direction --
  I won't be able to get to Dunedin if I do.
  ↳ could stay at Happy Inn Backpackers at Milton? That's about 65km of cycling.
    ↳ at least 3 hours of cycling to get into Dunedin from Milton…
  ↳ alternative, I could stay in a motel at Mosgiel?
    ↳ only an hour cycling into Dunedin from here, could be worth the $135!
  ↳ If I can make it to Mosgiel, there is a nice AirBnB there ($81)

    ↳ Only 2 hours left to book.The host will stop accepting bookings for your dates soon.
    ↳ oh, too bad, I don't want to lock it, I'd rather pay the extra money for a motel
