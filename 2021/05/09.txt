==================

Not feeling so flash this afternoon - my throat has a little tickle. I hope I
feel better tomorrow.

Cycling towards Dunedin today. Ended up staying a night at Lake Waihola. It's
quite nice here.

Either find a place to freedom camp (Memorial Park?)
what's the worst that could happen?
or fork out $135 for a motel room.

Cycling: 26.3km ~~ 1hr 33min
Make sure to take Christies Gully road, there is a big hill to get over to the
coast and this is the easiest path. Road might not be sealed, but a lot less
steep than the recommended route for cars.  Downside: nowhere to work from or
charge my laptop. The Brighton cafe is closed on Monday & Tuesday.
