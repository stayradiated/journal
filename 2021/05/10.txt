I thought he wask joking, but it's legit.
That said, it seems like a great way to get popular software developers to run
untrusted code on their laptop…

I followed these instructions: https://gist.github.com/KoryNunn/7d94d7e630881f99e02626b527e6fe15

The transaction worked! Just waiting for the exchange to update.

Price of HNS/USDT has dropped recently, might as well hold on to the coins
until I can get the most out of them and then convert them to bitcoin.
