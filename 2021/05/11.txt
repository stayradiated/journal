I am still sick.
My left ankle is still very sore to walk on.

Need to get myself to Dunedin.
Does the bus have a bike carrier?
If so, I can catch the bus into town.
Not sure how much stuff I can take in the panniers.

Fortunately the nearest bus stop is directly outside the motel. I walked out
there with a cup of tea and waited for the bus to arrive. The bus does have
bicycle mounting brackets on the front! Thanked the driver and walked back
inside.

Looking at staying in a dorm room aat the Chalet Backpackers.
$29 a night.

Will aim to catch the 12:30 bus into Dunedin.
Dunedin buses are on the Beecard system, which is handy.

Arrive at Chalet around 1:10 and book a room for a few nights.
Not sure of my plans now... Probably worth booking 2 nights.

Drying my shoes with the bathroom heater, my nose is blocked and I'm now afraid
that the whole room smells like wet socks.

Going to work from Blackstone Cafe this morning.

It's raining outside :(

dinner
------

I have some broccoli and mushrooms in my bag.
Could grab some more hummus and a carrot from the supermarket.

or… I could go and have ramen ­ it feels like a ramen day

shopping:
