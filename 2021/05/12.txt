dunedin
-------

Working from Wolf at the Door cafe all morning. I love this cafe and am glad to
see it's still operating. I told this to the owners and they said they only
bought it last year because they love the cafe as well.

The coffee is great, the food is great, the view is great.
It's just a neat little cafe and it's quite close to the hostel.

travel
------

If I don't feel like cycling (and right now I don't feel like cycling) I could
always catch the Intercity bus to Christchurch.
Or at least bus to Oamaru to get over the worst of the hills.

I should get in touch with Andrew while I'm in town and see if he's keen to
catch up.
