travel
------

- next 40 km to Waikouaiti -- 2hr 45min

Chatting to a guy at the dunedin hostel who has cycled over 5,000km around NZ!
He highly recommends getting clip pedals with shoes -- makes it a lot easier
going uphill because you can pull the pedal up, use different muscles, etc.

It would be neat to cycle out along the peninsula.
Would be a great ride on a clear day.
