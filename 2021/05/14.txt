The other backpackers are full as well.
Looks like it will be an average night.

What I can share with the team?

How about the feature flag manager…

email
-----

migrating from fastmail to migadu using imapsync
cheaper, incourages me to delete email I don't need
supports multiple domains, so I can use it to host czabania.com as well

imapsync config:

  docker run gilleslamiral/imapsync imapsync \
    --host1='imap.fastmail.com' \
    --user1='myusername@fastmail.com' \
    --password1='xxx' \
    --ssl1 \
    --sep1='.' \
    --prefix1='""' \
    --host2='imap.migadu.com' \
    --user2='myusername@stayradiated.com' \
    --password2='xxx' \
    --ssl2 \
    --maxage=500 \

notebook
--------

I bought a neat little notepag from Dutybound yesterday ($10).
I don't like storing notes on paper, but I love using pen/paper for jotting
down ideas and doodles.

IDEA:

1. jot down ideas on page 1 of notepad (including reverse side)
2. type up anything useful in my git journal
3. discard page 1 from notepad
4. page 2 becomes page 1
5. goto 1
