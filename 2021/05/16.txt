Otago

> Fine weather. Winds mainly light.

Waking up Warrington Reserve. It rained a little overnight, I was worried it
might rain again while I was packing up my gear, but thankfully it didn't.

I got very lucky with the weather, not a drop all day!

Avg Speed: 16.1km/h
Max Speed: 61.6km/h

Moving Time:  6:01:18
Elapsed Time: 8:07:28 

From Dunedin → Oamaru, following the coast as much as I can. It's a slower ride
than usual, with light headwinds and tired legs, but I enjoy the extra time
taking in the beach views.

Stopping at The Outpost cafe in Waikouaiti for a coffee and planning out the
rest of my day.

Checking in on the Moeraki Boulders, running along the beach barefoot. I think
I injurned my left ankle while running last weekend, because it really hurts to
run now…

Grabbing a tea at Vanessa's Cottage Cafe near Moeraki before heading along the
coastal roads to Oamaru.

Checking in at the Oamaru Backpackers, it's pretty quiet here. $35 a night.

Grabbing a scoop of chips ($2.60) for dinner, dipping them in a fancy hummus
while sitting in the dark park listening to Dan Carlin talk about Alexander.
