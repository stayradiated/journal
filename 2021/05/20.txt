baking
------

There are a bunch of garden grown green apples at the backpackers.
I would like to bake an apple crumble for desert.

https://www.chelsea.co.nz/browse-recipes/apple-crumble-1120/

- ½ cup Edmonds Standard Grade Flour
- ¼ cup rolled oats
- ¼ cup desiccated coconut
- ¼ cup Chelsea Soft Brown Sugar
- ½ tsp mixed spice or cinnamon
- 75g Tararua Butter
- 5-6 Granny Smith apples
- 2 Tbsp Chelsea Golden Syrup
- 2 Tbsp Chelsea Raw Sugar or Demerara Sugar

Pre-heat oven to 190°C conventional or 170ºC fan-forced.

In a bowl, mix the Edmonds Standard Grade Flour, oats, coconut, Chelsea Soft Brown Sugar and cinnamon together, then rub in the Tararua Butter until the mixture becomes combined and crumbly.

Peel and cut apples into wedges and place in an oven-proof dish. Drizzle with the Chelsea Golden Syrup.

Spread the crumble mixture over the top of the apples. Sprinkle the Chelsea Raw Sugar or Demerara Sugar over the top for an extra crunchy topping. Bake for 40-45 minutes until apples are cooked.

Serve while hot with vanilla ice-cream, cream or custard.
