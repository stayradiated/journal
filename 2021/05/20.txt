baking
------

There are a bunch of garden grown green apples at the backpackers.
I would like to bake an apple crumble for desert.

https://www.chelsea.co.nz/browse-recipes/apple-crumble-1120/

- ½ cup Edmonds Standard Grade Flour
- ¼ cup rolled oats
- ¼ cup desiccated coconut
- ¼ cup Chelsea Soft Brown Sugar
- ½ tsp mixed spice or cinnamon
- 75g Tararua Butter
- 5-6 Granny Smith apples
- 2 Tbsp Chelsea Golden Syrup
- 2 Tbsp Chelsea Raw Sugar or Demerara Sugar

Pre-heat oven to 190°C conventional or 170ºC fan-forced.

In a bowl, mix the Edmonds Standard Grade Flour, oats, coconut, Chelsea Soft Brown Sugar and cinnamon together, then rub in the Tararua Butter until the mixture becomes combined and crumbly.

Peel and cut apples into wedges and place in an oven-proof dish. Drizzle with the Chelsea Golden Syrup.

Spread the crumble mixture over the top of the apples. Sprinkle the Chelsea Raw Sugar or Demerara Sugar over the top for an extra crunchy topping. Bake for 40-45 minutes until apples are cooked.

Serve while hot with vanilla ice-cream, cream or custard.

Need to check that we have a cake baking tin first. Also considering doing a cake mix hack so I don't have to waste unused flour/sugar/butter etc

rules for moderated eating
---------------------------

So you've got a packet of biscuits, nice one - but you know shouldn't eat them all in one sitting. How do you make i last a whole week?Same goes for dates, peanut butter, hummus, etc. 

two simple rules:

- You can only open a packet once  per day.
- You cannot eat anything from within a packet while it is open.

ideas:

- Forces you to choose out how much you want to eat upfront. Doesn't limit how much you eat, I could still eat a whole packet of biscuits, but I would have to want to do that. Prevents the "just one more" issue. 
- Forced scarcity induces rationing, once the biscuits are on the plate you know that is all you getting today.

Will this work? I think it will, it depends on me being able to follow the two rules. 

Loop holes:

- Doesn't limit how many packets you can have. I could own multiple packets of biscuits for eating during different times of the day. 

Flaws:

- Requires that a packet has open/closed states: a packet of biscuits requires a food peg to properly close.
