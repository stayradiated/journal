Just realised that cheese rolls are "deep south" thing.
I wonder if they are common in christchurch, I don't remember noticing them.
I haven't tried one yet, they don't seem that appealing.

Bushy Beach is only a 15 minute bike ride from the backpackers.

Finished reading Cory Doctorow's "Down & Out in the Magic Kingdom"

Watching a lot of Michael Stevens videos.

Baking a chocolate pudding for desert. Only small butter I could get from
