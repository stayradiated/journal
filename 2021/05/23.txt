travel
------

I could cycle 30km to the Rakaia River Holiday Park.
Should only take 1hr 30min

There are a couple of cafes I could work from.

Afterwards I could cycle to Rolleston and stay at an AirBnB?

Or I could take a day off and cycle to Christchurch?

What is the weather doing this week?
ie. is it going to be an awful idea to stay in a tent?

Weather looks fine this week, it's going to be a bit cold (2°) but should be
fine.

Found this great photo from the opening ceremony of the Rakaia Bridge in 1939.

I love the clothes, the hats, the expressions, it's just a great photo.
