money
-----

I really like Wise but it has a couple of downsides.

- The VISA card doesn't work at places that don't take credit cards. This means
  I have to use my TSB card and should always keep some money on it.
- Some places only take cash and to get cash out I need to use my TSB card.
- While it is free to transfer from TSB → Wise, transferring NZD from Wise →
  TSB incurs a $0.76 fee -- I should avoid doing this if possible.

brian
-----

I have checked Brian into the Stoked Cycles bicycle shop in Ashburton.
Hopefully they can get the highest gear working correctly -- might be time for
a new chain again?
