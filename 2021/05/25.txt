===================

Ashburton
---------

Checking out of the Ramblers Rest backpackers.

Working from Triangle Espresso this morning, perhaps the best cafe in Ashburton.

Cycling to Rakaia at midday.

food
----

- 1 short black coffee @ triangle espresso
- 2 poached eggs on foacaccia bread with spinach and hollandaise sauce
- 1 slice of bacon & egg pie
- 1 date scone, toasted with butter
- 1 can chickpeas, roasted
- 1 small red kumara, roasted
- 1 head of brocolli, roasted
- 200g garlic/lemon hummus
- 1 block of cadbury milk chocolate
- 2 small apples
- ½ tub no-salt-added smooth peanut butter

todo
----

- [x] book accomodation for Rolleston on Airbnb ($70)

work
----

learning & development day, writing a blog post about the Runn API

- [x] check if heroku support have got back to us
- [ ] create github repo with demo code for synching toggl with runn

Found this thread discussing the `getent` error we have been getting on Heroku.

https://github.com/Runn-Fast/runn/pull/6130

Turns out the fix is to run as a non-root user, so odd.

tomorrow
--------

Cycling to Rolleston, about 35km ~ 1h 45min.
Worst bit is going to be to crossing the Rakaia River, a 2km long bridge with
no shoulders and lots of traffic. Hopefully the drivers are patient with me…
