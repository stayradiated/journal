travel
------

How long do spend in Christchurch?
I would like to cycle to Nelson, via the west coast.
What do I need to be prepared for?
Do not want to rush… maybe hang around in chch for a bit?
I would like to be able to enjoy my trip.
I need to be in Wellington on the 23rd though.

parkrun
-------

Haven't been for a 5km race in a while, did pretty well considering.

I have got a gnarly blister on toe 0, from rubbing against the sandal strap.

Got a call from Jaime this morning, asking if I'd be keen to come to a gig this
evening.
We are going to see a local band, The Butlers at 20:00.
Booked a ticket, $47.

Bus will take ~50 minutes to get to Blue Smoke.

update:

Caught an Ola ride to the Blue Smoke. ID checked, ticket scanned, wrist band attached. 

It's amazing much of a difference a crowd makes to a place. What was an nearly empty room is now a wriggling mass of bodies, the air is alive with shouted conversations. 

Jaime couldn't make it in the end- the rain has flooded the river and she can't walk or drive over the bridge. Her room has also been flooded pit so she has had to move her stuff upstairs! She apologised but it was out of her control, not much you can do about extreme weather events. 

Standard attire for guys:
- Dark navy long sleeved shirt, untucked
- Dark skinny jeans
- Black boots

Alternative:
-- Lots of colour
-- Vintage
-- Corduroy
-- Bowler beanier

There are 3 acts:
1. Annie Evergreen ? A voice like Tiny Ruins but you can't dance to the music. Has a song aboout "Annie in Motueka" and "Tough Love". I really like her music, I wish I could find her online -- I should ask her name. 
2. Muroki - loud, good beat, has a cover of Sam Sparrow's Black and Gold that was pretty good
3. The Butlers. This is who the people here for. Arctic Monkeys but from NZ and with a guy wearing a mask made from a Double Brown box playing a saxophone. High energy sound mixed with wavy bass. Easily the most danceable act, very confident on stage. 

Takeaways:
- Concerts are better with friends
- Always bring ear plugs
- The way people dress in christchurch is fascinating
- I still feel quite of my depth at bars. I don't want to drink, the loud music prohibits conversations, it seems impossible to introduce myself to someone. 
- Small music gigs at local bars seem like very distinct events, it would be worth keeping an eye out for gigs while travelling, though I guess only the bigger cities will have the better acts. 
- Always check the flash is off before video in a dark room, especially in WhatsApp. 

I think I'm going to catch a bus back to the hostel?



benji
-----

With a little bit more of mum's help I've got Benji back up and running.
Just needed to manually restart the box.

I'm going to upgrade Benji's packages and make sure it's healthy.
It would be great to run Benji in the cloud so it's easier to debug, but that's
expensive.

Anyway, it's great to have my music server back.

…

So I rebooted the server and it hasn't come back online :(
Poor benji.

arch-linux
----------

Having issues with not being able to install packages.

> error: key XYZ could not be looked up remotely

Had to update /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf to read:

    no-greeting
    no-permission-warning
    lock-never

    keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net
    keyserver-options timeout=10
    keyserver-options import-clean
    keyserver-options no-self-sigs-only

And then running `pacman-key --refresh-keys`
