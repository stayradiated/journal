With a little bit more of mum's help I've got Benji back up and running.
Just needed to manually restart the box.

I'm going to upgrade Benji's packages and make sure it's healthy.
It would be great to run Benji in the cloud so it's easier to debug, but that's
expensive.

Anyway, it's great to have my music server back.
