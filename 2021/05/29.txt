travel
------

How long do spend in Christchurch?
I would like to cycle to Nelson, via the west coast.
What do I need to be prepared for?
Do not want to rush… maybe hang around in chch for a bit?
I would like to be able to enjoy my trip.
I need to be in Wellington on the 23rd though.

parkrun
-------

Haven't been for a 5km race in a while, did pretty well considering.

I have got a gnarly blister on toe 0, from rubbing against the sandal strap.

jaime
-----

Got a call from Jaime this morning, asking if I'd be keen to come to a gig this
evening.
We are going to see a local band, The Butlers at 20:00.
Booked a ticket, $47.

Bus will take ~50 minutes to get to Blue Smoke.



benji
-----

With a little bit more of mum's help I've got Benji back up and running.
Just needed to manually restart the box.

I'm going to upgrade Benji's packages and make sure it's healthy.
It would be great to run Benji in the cloud so it's easier to debug, but that's
expensive.

Anyway, it's great to have my music server back.

…

So I rebooted the server and it hasn't come back online :(
Poor benji.

arch-linux
----------

Having issues with not being able to install packages.

> error: key XYZ could not be looked up remotely

Had to update /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf to read:

    no-greeting
    no-permission-warning
    lock-never

    keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net
    keyserver-options timeout=10
    keyserver-options import-clean
    keyserver-options no-self-sigs-only

And then running `pacman-key --refresh-keys`
