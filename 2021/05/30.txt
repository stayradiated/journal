early morning
-------------

It's midnight and the gig is over.
Buses are no longer raining and rideshare services are at exorbitant prices due
to high demand.
So I'm walking back from Blue Smoke in the pouring rain, it takes 80 minutes.
I have my raincoat with me, which keeps my upper body dry, but my shoes, socks
and pants soak through.

I listen to Lex Fridman discuss conciousness with Sam Harris, it's fascinating.
I got Sam Harris mixed up with Sam Altman and was wondering why they hadn't
even mentioned Y Combinator…

Anyway, made it back to the Jailhouse hostel. Had a hot shower and went to
sleep reading "The Systems Bible".

…

Waking up to messages from Jo.
I put on some dry clothes and head downstairs.
We have a short conversation but the connection is poor quality, frequently
cutting out. Hopefully she finds some wifi this week.
Jo is currently in the Isles of Scilly (pronouced "silly") -- the weather is
lovely and she had a whole day off to go visit the islands.

…

My clothes didn't dry.

My pants are still damp.
My socks are soaking.
My shoes are wet.

ios development

Purchased an Apple Developer Membership this morning.

I hope so too Apple.

Following these instructions to generate certificates, super useful.

Tried to understand how to configure CodeMagic to build my expo app.
Found this very confusing.

Also discovered that `expo` can build iOS apps as well, without having to be on a mac.
Very nice.
Took a few goes to get the certificates working properly.
Now I have a .ipa file.

Didn't expect uploading the file to be a challenge, but it is.
Apple doesn't have an easy way to upload files if you are not on a mac.
Best bet so far is to use `fastlane deliver`.
Wish me luck.

…

Doesn't look like fastlane supports linux.
