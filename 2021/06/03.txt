Runn has bought me a new laptop.

I want to see if I can get the WWAN working…
Start by loading in the card from my old laptop into the new one,
see if that works with windows.

update: that didn't work
The Sierra chip I have in my gen 6 isn't supported by the gen 9.
It will literally refuse to boot!

Might have to order one of these guys:

Also, do I want to try keeping arch linux as the host OS?
