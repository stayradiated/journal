full disk ecryption

most important thing:

> Warning: As of version 2.0.4 GRUB does not support LUKS2 headers; see GRUB bug

> support but does not support Argon2i or Argon2id PBKDFs.

new laptop
----------

The host user should NOT have the same name as the docker user.

It's currently quite confusing on my current setup when I am prompted with:

    [sudo] password for admin:

And I don't know if I am authenticating to the host or vm.

Maybe the host user should be called 'host' so its obvious.
