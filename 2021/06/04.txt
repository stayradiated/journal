most important thing:

> Warning: As of version 2.0.4 GRUB does not support LUKS2 headers; see GRUB bug
> #55093. Make sure to specify --type luks1 when creating the encrypted boot
> partition using cryptsetup luksFormat. grub-gitAUR has gained limited LUKS2
> support but does not support Argon2i or Argon2id PBKDFs.
