problem:

Grub would display error about "boot/vmlinuz-linux not found" and "you need to
load the kernal first".

Everyone on the internet is just saying to reinstall the "linux" package, but I
still couldn't get it to boot until I rebuilt the grub config.

solution:

Boot from an arch linux live USB

    mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
    mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
    arch-chroot /mnt

    ping google.com # you will need to internet for this next bit
    pacman -Syu
    pacman -S linux
    pacman -S mkinitcpio

    rm -r /boot/EFI
    grub-install --target=x86_64-efi  --bootloader-id=grub_uefi --recheck --efi-directory=/boot
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

    exit
    umount -R /mnt
    reboot
