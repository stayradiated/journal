Ivan is such a great guy, he invited me out to join him and his mates to Smash
Palace where they played a few games of speed chess. I played two games but
wasn't feeling very well and got destroyed very quickly.

Vanessa joined us and we walked to Urbanz so I could pick up my bike and drop
off my bag. We cycled to COCA (Center of Contemporary Art), a local art gallery
where there was an exhibition on (with free drinks).

- The Near Future by Hannah Watkinson (https://coca.org.nz/exhibitions/the-near-future)
  * "I began photographing the coastline of the Buller region with the knowledge
    that at some point, in the near future, the topography would change; rising
    sea levels, coastal erosion, the winding Coast Road slipping towards the deep
    blue. In 2015 I was unaware that, like most of the timeframes in Buller, the
    near future would come a lot sooner than I expected and would unfold before
    my eyes.
- Mark Work by Raukura Turei, Julian Hooper & Krystina Kaza, Areta Wilkinson,
  Warwick Freeman, Hannah Beehre (https://coca.org.nz/exhibitions/mark-work)
  * This was my favourite piece, a new collection of alphabet letters recreated
    using rules and symbols, i.e. the uppercase letters drawn using lowercase
    letters, or letters drawn using numbers. It was really fun trying to figure
    out the rules.
- The Mist and the Horizon by Nathan Pōhio and Luke Shaw
  (https://coca.org.nz/exhibitions/the-mist-and-the-horizon)
  * I didn't really get this piece, but it looked cool. There was an area where
    a droning sound was played out of two speakers and depending on where you
    stood the volume would change due to wave interference, so that was fun to
    play with.

Vanessa thought I was vegan and had suggested we have dinner at BirdWood pizza,
but after learning I'm not vegan suggested we grab fried chicken instead. So we
cycled to Monster Chicken in Riccarton. I haven't had fried chicken in ages and
it was very delicious.

I sneakily shouted dinner, because Ivan and Vanessa are awesome friends. Hoping
to catch up with them again on Sunday for a chill day walk up a mountain.

Working from the BNZ Community101 co-working space on Cashel St today.
I can't believe they don't charge people to work here!

There are some downsides though:
- no free tea/coffee
- no bathroom

winter/august
-------------

I really want to get into snowboarding this year.
It would be neat to fly Dad & James down to the slopes as well and spend a
weekend out there.

I think getting out there at least 10 time would be good.
