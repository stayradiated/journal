kiwi-coin
---------

Basically spent all day working on my kiwi-coin project.
Added a bunch of features.

- order-book now shows relative price to "worldwide" price
- trades how include calculated fields
- watch-price now prints out the current price every 5 seconds

wifi.txt
--------

I've re-formatted my list of wifi passwords to use a markdown table, it's a lot
easier to read now.

I found this neat plugin to make managing the table easy-peasy as well:

vim-table-mode
--------------

https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode

This plugin changes the game when working with tables in Vim.
I'm so keen to try out the spreadsheeting mode as well!

Tried buying the developer a coffee through buymeacoffee.com, but his Paypal
account is restricted?

Sponsored the project through this page instead:

travel
------

I've booked James and I a room at the U Boutique Hotel Wellington.
The Marion and Dwellington were both booked out, this place looks pretty cool
though -- and only $93 a night for two people, it's not tooo expensive.
