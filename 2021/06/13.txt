- cycling to South Christchurch Library where I met up with Ivan and Vanessa at
  9:30am.
- we cycled to Mount Vernon carpark, locked our bikes up and walked up to the
  summit, arriving there around 11am.
- I brought my discgolf disc with me and we threw it around a bit. I nearly
  lost it in the tussock grass.

tmux

If you ever want to dump the entire scrollback buffer of a pane, use this
command:

  tmux capture-pane -pS - > file

bitcoin
-------

I implemented the first version of my "auto-buy" kiwi-coin code.  It's super
basic -- every 5 minutes it cancels any open orders and then creates a new
order at 1.5% below the current price reported on Binance. I let it run all
night and managed to spend $400 on bitcoin before my account run out of funds.

I think there a lot of things I could do better.

- Check on the date of the last order, use this to dynamically set the amount.
  It should gradually increase until someone buys and then drop down again.
  Start by targeting an average of $5 an hour.
- Take the lowest ask into account. If we create an order that is greater or
  equal to the top ask, we pay an extra 0.4% fee to kiwi-coin.com. If the top
  ask is 0.4% lower than our desired price, take it, otherwise drop to a cent
  below the top ask price so we pay less in fees. 
  * Better idea, assume that the lowest ask is price is sensible and never go
    above it.
- Could try maintaining multiple orders at different rates
- Could try checking the open orders and adjust my price to be a cent above the
  next highest order. This seems a bit cheeky though.

benji

Benji is behaving oddly. I changed the system timezon to Pacific/Auckland and
now I can't use `sudo` anymore… I also don't know the root password so I can't
easily fix it - I can't even reboot!

I think if it doesn't fix itself I will have to get mum to do a manual reboot
via the power button. If I can `sudo` back into root afterwards, I should reset
the root password and add it to my password manager.

At least in the meantime I can live inside my docker shell and build the latest
version of my image.
