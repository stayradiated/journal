7:27am/8:00am → 5:01pm/5:34pm

Woke up with a roaring headache.
I had two drinks yesterday, not if sure that is enough for a hangover.
I also ate an entire loaf of banana bread, which certainly didn't help.

I woke up, tidied up my gear, let the team know I was taking a sick day and
then went back to bed.

I lay in bed all morning, waking up again at 11:00. I cycled to the Uprising
gym and went bouldering for an hour. I should try and do this each day.
Managed to complete a few yellow climbs and make decent progress on orange.

Cycled back into the city centre, picked up a salmon rice ball and ate at
Saltworks. James received an email last week saying that the Department of
Internal Affairs couldn't find his citizenship information. I need to call them
and find out if we can get a refund on the application while we sort out the
citizenship details.
