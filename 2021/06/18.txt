todo
----

- [ ] book a haircut for Wednesday morning
- [ ] go for a park run

spreadsheets
------------

I need a great spreadsheet that I can edit in the terminal.
vim-table-mode is pretty good, but it's formulas are limited.

- sc (https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10699)
- oleo (https://www.gnu.org/software/oleo/)

I haven't tried oleo yet, but `sc` is amazing.
I've started tracking my spending using it.

I really like how it uses a plaintext file format + it automatically exports as
a text file.

work
----

Taking another half day today.

schedule
--------

0630 wake up
0700 working from Cafe L'affare
0930 head back to the hotel
1000 standup
1145 lunch at Cafe L'affare with James

todo
----

- [.] wash/dry my clothes

tailscale
---------

https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale

Brendon has alerted me to Tailscale. I've used WireGuard in the past, but it
can be a little tricky to configure.

It would be good to get Benji setup with WireGuard again, instead of having to
keep an SSH port exposed on the internet.

supabase
--------

https://supabase.io/

Looks pretty cool, could be a good backend for KC?
I wonder if I can use zapatos/pg with it though?

food
----

- 1 short black coffee 
- 1 tomato and chorizo soup
