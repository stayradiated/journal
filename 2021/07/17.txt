====================

Rotorua.
Bucketing down with rain all day.
Awful floods in Westport, very glad I am in Rotorua.
Feeling a bit tired this morning, post vaccine.

Had a great chat with Jo this morning, she is in Fort William, she is on on her
way to Pelican tomorrow.

- [ ] send a postcard to Jo's parents
- [x] fix benji server (install void linux?)
