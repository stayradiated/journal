caps2esc (interception-tools) with void-linux
---------------------------------------------

# install dependencies on void-linux

    sudo xbps-install -S \
      cmake make gcc pkgconf \
      libudev-devel boost-devel yaml-cpp-devel libevdev-devel

# build interception-tools and interception-caps2sc

for each project, git clone, cd etc and then use cmake to build:

    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    cmake --build build --target install

# create keyboard config

the name of the keyboard may not be the same as mine

    mkdir -p /etc/interception
    uinput -p -d /dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd \
      | tee /etc/interception/keyboard.yaml

# cat /etc/interception/udevmon.yaml

check what inputs you have in /dev/input/by-path and update accordingly

    - CMD: mux -c caps2esc
    - JOB: mux -i caps2esc | caps2esc | uinput -c /etc/interception/keyboard.yaml
    - JOB: intercept -g $DEVNODE | mux -o caps2esc
      DEVICE:
        LINK: /dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd
    - JOB: intercept $DEVNODE | mux -o caps2esc
      DEVICE:
        LINK: /dev/input/by-path/pci-0000:00:15.0-platform-i2c_designware.0-event-mouse

# cat /etc/sv/udevmon/run

You will need to install this service as usual
then you can do stuff like `sudo sv restart udevmon`

    #!/bin/sh
    exec /usr/local/bin/udevmon -c /etc/interception/udevmon.yaml
