=====================

Pick a date to fly to London.
Would prefer a wednesday? Why?

- [x] quickly get to the Cycle Work Shop and replace cassette and chain
      - they are closed until August 4th!
- [x] catching up with Jo ♥
- [ ] plan out where I am riding to tomorrow (berlins, murchison?)
  - murchison is 100km away, that's quite a long day of cycling!
  - there is also Lyall's campsite, halfway between berlins and murchison

RUNN

TOMORROW

- [ ] purchase Apple earpod replacements?
  - I thought that Westport had a Noel Leemings… it doesn't.
  - It has a small tech store (100% Ellerys), they must have something
    * https://www.100percent.co.nz/tv-and-audio/audio/portable-and-personal/TAUE101WT/Philips-Earphones.html
    * they open at 9am
  - alternatively: try cycling with noise-cancelling headphones, but only the
    left ear.
