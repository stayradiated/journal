====================

Camping at Lyell's campground.
Water is not treated, I really should have bought some aqua tabs with me.
It's $8 a night.
No fires allowed.
Prepare for sandflies.

Purchasing cheap hedaphones from New World for $19.
Surprisingly good quality.

Cycle cycle cycle.
Rear tube went flat around halfway, not entirely flat, but enough that I didn't
want to continue on it.
I tried pumping it back up, but I could hear the air leaking out.
I changed the tube, the trickiest bit was getting the tyre out of the rim --
requires a lot of force and smart placement of tyre levers.
One car stopped to check if I needed any help, I appreciated that.

Well, I made it to Murchison.
Berlins wasn't open, so I couldn't refill my water bottle there.
I arrived at Lyell campground around 2:15pm, but decided I would carry on to
Murchison.

Staying at the Lazy Cow backpackers. It hasn't changed much.
Having dinner next door at The Cow Shed, they are doing a tapas week.
The owner is a cool guy, he gave me a free beer for cycling here from Westport.
I had a veggie pizza.

Eating a big tub of chocolate ice cream and watching the first half of The Big
Short.
