==================

At the Lazy Cow backpackers.
Guess what, they have a full on bike shop downstairs, complete with bike stand
and the wrench I need to change out the cassette.
I wish I had bought a new chain with me!
I'm going to change out the cassette anyway, I'm sure that will help out a lot.

I'm headed to St Arnaud today.
60km, all uphill.

Weather is looking good for today/tomorrow.
Sunday is a 50/50 on rain after midday.

...

Could stay in St Arnaud another night. $35.
Rainbow Skifield. $135 lift pass with rental gear.
Cycle to Nelson on Sunday.  St Arnaud 4h 30m.
Going to try hitching to the Rainbow Ski Area. About an 1hr 10min

...

Playing Yahtzee with the ski field folks in Alpine Lodge.
Sarah, Daniel, Jared, Blain.
I won the first game with 273 points.
Lost the second game trying to only go for a Yahtzee. Didn't get a yahtzee.

There is ~5% chance of rolling Yahtzee apparently.
Feels a lot lessâ€¦

The game seems to be based on Generala
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generala

...

Waking up tomorrow at 6:30 to join Sarah and Jared in a morning yoga session.
