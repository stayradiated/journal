RETRO NOTES

- Rowan should avoid merging PRs without anyone approving them first
  * If necessary, at least request a post-merge review just so people are aware
    of what has changed.
- Rowan: With PRs, lets try keep them in “Draft” state until we want someone to
  review them.This will both let people know when something is ready to be
  reviewed, but also help us in keeping track of the “how long to review” KPI
  for developers.
