TODO

- [x] update expenses
  - [x] complete spreadsheet for July
  - [x] start new expenses spreadsheet for August
  - I wish I had a better understanding of how SC works
- [/] get James to Nelson for the weekend!
  - Whaat!? Air NZ don't fly directly from Rotorua to Nelson :( 
  - Well that rules that out, James would not enjoy transiting through
    Wellington by himself.
