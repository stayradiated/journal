=== NELSON =====================================================================

I think it's going to be a wet day on Friday.
Oh well, we can handle this.

Saturday should be lovely though.

=== AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS =========================================================

I really should get Banksy back up and running again, he was a very useful bot
to have. I'm not sure if the microservice architecture was the best idea -- I
might refactor it into a single Docker image with a SQL database.
