PICTON

Should be a nice day.

METSERVICE

This is the best description of their API I've found:
https://github.com/ZephireNZ/PyMetService/blob/master/pymetservice/__init__.py

But it only works with places that fall unde "towns-cities"
I don't know how to fetch data about rual regions from metservice.
