Ohhhhh
Misread that email.
I was supposed to catch the ferry THIS MORNINGâ€¦
Next ferry out is on Tuesday arvo.
Next available flight is on Wednesday morning.
Looks like I'm spending Tuesday night in Wellington.

...


Listening to "Michigan Left" by the Arkells. It's an album I've had in my
library for ages, but I don't remember it. Quite good.

...

Lunch: trying out toasted cheese, onion and pineapple sandwhich from Toastie.
Neat business idea: sell $10 toasted sandwhiches and coffee.
Quite popular.

Ate a whole packet of chocolate/coconut macaroon biscuits while thinking about
being in Picton until Tuesday.

Supermarket Dal Makahni curry, brown rice/quinoa and pappadums with mango
chutney for dinner. Badly burnt the first batch of pappadums, big smoke.

Not many guests at this hostel in Picton.
Basically just me and this elderly scottish woman.

Annabelle arrived today. She's from the UK but has been living in NZ for the
past 3 years. She lives on a boat in Nelson! Thinking about moving to Picton
(and maybe moving into a house?) She has done a lot of tramping around NZ,
including multiple 8+ day hikes. She is also a big fan of dates + peanut butter
- suggests putting them in a wrap, makes a good tramping lunch.
