PICTON
------

I will be here another night.
Would be a good day to get some washing out.
Update: did that, fresh clean clothes are so good.

Went for a midday run up to the Tirohanga track. Slippery with mud, I did very
well not to fall over. The view from the top is fantastic, there is even a
thoughtfully placed bench. I continued along the track to Garden Terrace, where
one must cross a shallow river to get back into town. With all the rain
yesterday the river was probably a bit more full than usual, but it was all
good - and quite refreshing!

Having a great time chatting to the other guests here:
- Annabelle: a woman from the UK (30ish?) experienced sailor, living on a
  sailboat, thinking of moving to Picton, works odd jobs she can find, likes
  working as a sailmaker. Lived in Greece for 2 years on a boat, recommends
  Sailing Holidays. Has done a lot of hiking, including alpine hikes. She has
  met many inspiring people, a few of who live in the Bay of Islands, including
  Annie Hill (https://anniehill.blogspot.com/). She recommends her book
  "Voyaing on a Small Income". I would love to read it.
- Ruth: a woman from Germany (late 30s?) who I find quite intimidating, she is
  quite friendly though and has a funny sense of humour. She also works on her
  laptop from Le Cafe, plus she recommended trying out the tree house at the
  back of the hostel. She wears this beautiful steampunk compass on here wrist,
  similar to how one wears a watch. She said that she is a retired pilot and
  loves hiking through the backcountry.
- Mike: a kiwi guy (40) who is moving vans between christchurch/auckland as a
  side-gig. His passion is to produce music and we had a great chat about
  music, DJing and technology. Cool dude. He recommends I checkout Serato -
  which is world class DJ software built in NZ!

XI RETROSPECTIVE
----------------

Stumbled across this fantastic article about the Xi editor.

> Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing
> goals related to project management, not technical excellence.
> Ideally, once youâ€™ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams
> can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes
> down.
> I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to
 large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects.
> And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big
> companies tend to have more resources.

DISK SPACE
----------

Benji has out of disk space.
I will need to do some cleaning up.
How do you sort directories by file size?
Might try re-encoding music to a different format?
