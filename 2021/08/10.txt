Sailing to Picton today (big ferry).

Chatting to the Le Cafe girl.
She is "stuck" in Picton, thinking about returning to Australia.
Turns out for the past 9 months she has been living on a yacht! With a large
German Shepard dog (Freida)! Her yacht is out in the Picton harbour. Her father
is a sailor.

Trying to find the the matching row from ~24 hours ago.
How do you do this?

SELECT cur_market_price.*, ROUND((cur_market_price.price_nzd / prev_market_price.price_nzd * 100) - 100, 2) as change
 FROM kc.market_price as cur_market_price
 JOIN kc.market_price as prev_market_price
   on
     prev_market_price.symbol = cur_market_price.symbol AND
     prev_market_price.market_uid = cur_market_price.market_uid AND
     prev_market_price.timestamp < cur_market_price.timestamp - interval '1440 minutes' AND
     prev_market_price.timestamp > cur_market_price.timestamp - interval '1441 minutes'
 ORDER BY cur_market_price.timestamp DESC
 LIMIT 20
