webpack: try using swc as a plugin
It's so much faster, it's silly!
I wonder if we can use this instead of ncc?

- We can't vaccinate our way out of a pandemic, it's just too infectious.
- There is a massive community benefit of everyone being vaccinated.

Ashley on Vaccine Hesitancy:

> I've never felt that vaccine hesitancy is the problem, because we know that most people:
> - if they have information from someone they trust
> - and the vaccine is offered in a setting and by someone they trust
> - they will take up that offer.

Reconnecting New Zealanders to the world: Next steps
----------------------------------------------------

Our approach is guided by five objectives:
..........................................

- 1. Maintaining our elimination strategy to stamp out the virus and keep our
  options open.
- 2. Ensuring every eligible New Zealander is offered the opportunity to be
  vaccinated as soon as possible.
- 3. Reducing the need for further lockdowns as much as possible by continuing
  to strengthen our health and contact tracing systems.
- 4. Maintaining strong public health tools.
- 5. Developing new ways to enable people to travel safely to and from New
  Zealand.

Step 1. Immediate response andpre-general population vaccination
................................................................

- 14 days’ MIQ required for everyone (except QFT zones)
- Travel restricted to New Zealand citizens and residents, and limited
  economic/humanitarian exemptions
- Testing required pre-departure and once in New Zealand
- Alert level restrictions are primary method of controlling outbreaks
- Health measures like mandatory face coverings and QR scanning are key
  prevention tools
- Priority groups (border workers,at-risk populations) vaccinated

Step 2. General population vaccination and development of additional tools
..........................................................................

- Vaccination of general population underway
- Pilot scheme of new flexible pathways into New Zealand, testing safe
  alternatives to 14 days’ MIQ
- 14 days’ MIQ remains compulsory for everyone else (except QFT zones)
- Additional testing requirements to monitor reduced time in MIQ
- ICU/health capacity and contact tracing systems strengthened, in response to
  Delta and other variants
- Alert level restrictions remain primary method of controlling outbreaks
- Work to develop traveller declaration for vaccine and testing information

Step 3. New travel pathways reflecting risk
...........................................

- Phased implementation of three new pathways into New Zealand:LOW RISK:
  Vaccinated travellers from low risk countries: no isolation requiredMEDIUM
  RISK: Vaccinated travellers from medium risk countries: modified isolation
  requirementsHIGH RISK: Unvaccinated travellers and all travellers from high
  risk countries: 14 days’ MIQ
- Testing regime remains in place
- Countries regularly assessed for risk
- Alert levels and public health measures are still in place, but lockdowns are
  less likely

Step 4. QFT for all vaccinated travellers
.........................................

- Quarantine free travel for vaccinated travellers who return a negative test
- 14 days’ MIQ for the majority of unvaccinated travellers
- Resilient population and resilient health systems
- Testing at the border and public health measures like QR scanning still in
  place
- Booster vaccinations may be required

What we’re looking for to give us confidence to move steps:
...........................................................

Where are we now:

- Highest risk populations vaccinated, and vaccine rollout ramping up 

Next up:

- High coverage of vaccine in New Zealand within high-risk populations and
  across regions
- Vaccine remains effective 
- We’re able to maintain elimination strategy

Future:

- Vaccine remains effective
- Behaviour of variants stabilised
- Strong confidence in our system
