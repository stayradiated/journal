Singapore Baggage
-----------------

Isn't baggage a fun word to say? Baggage, baggage, baggage. BAGGAGE!

Cabin Baggage:

- Main bag:
  * weight <= 7kg
  * sum(length, width, height) <= 115cm
- Laptop in bag:
  * max dimensions = 40cm x 30cm x 10cm

Checked Baggage:

> You are strongly advised against packing valuable and fragile items in your
> checked baggage, such as Laptop, Important Documents, etc.

- Baggage:
  * 1 piece
  * weight <= 25kg
  * size <= 200cm (length) x 75cm (width) x 80cm (height)

HOLDALL
-------

- Light weight (so it doesn't eat into my 25kg)
- Collapses down for easy storage when not being used
- Has wheels (to make it easier to transport)
- Not too expensive (don't plan to use it too much)

Kmart ($35)

Briscoes ($150)

Pre-requisities:
- Get all the stuff together that I am taking with me.
- Figure out how much space it is going to take up + weight.

Also worth checking TradeMe and second hand shops.
People who recently arrived and don't need their bag anymore?
Also check with parents first, mum might have something stashed away.



RUNN
----

Migrating the front-end away from Rails.

Use Next.js to build out the front-end.

What do we about auth?
We will need to add a mutation action Hasura that can generate auth tokens.
Ideally pass the username/password to Hasura which calls our Ruby server.

Front-end should only talk to Hasura?
How does it get the Hasura endpoint?
Need to load it from /user/current_session.
