===================

brain.
My head aches this morning.
I ate too much peanut butter yesterday.
I don't think it's related.

wifi grumbles.
I hate it when the wifi doesn't work.
It wouldn't be so bad if I could debug where the issue is.
Is it my laptop? Software? Hardware? Is it the router? Is it something on the
network?
