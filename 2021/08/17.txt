brain.
My head aches this morning.
I ate too much peanut butter yesterday.
I don't think it's related.

wifi grumbles.
I hate it when the wifi doesn't work.
It wouldn't be so bad if I could debug where the issue is.
Is it my laptop? Software? Hardware? Is it the router? Is it something on the

How do people write blog posts?
It's so difficult.
Big respect for all you bloggers out there.
