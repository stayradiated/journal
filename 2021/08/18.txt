=====================

back in level 4.
stay inside, stay safe.
let's hope this is over before september 10.
i need to get to auckland.

tailscale.
finally configured tailscale on my computers.
it's pretty nice.

going to clean up my room today.

i haven't used my mechanical keyboard in a long while.
it's quite a nice typing experience.
would be nice to get a new cable for it.
i should probably bring my trackpad with me as well.
