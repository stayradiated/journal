==================

sudoscripts.
create a new directory: /root/sudoscripts
put in scripts that you normally need sudo to execute.
edit sudoers file: sudo visudo
  host ALL = NOPASSWD: /root/sudoscripts/*.sh
Now the host can `sudo /root/sudoscripts/sv-restart-udevmon.sh` without having
to enter a password!
