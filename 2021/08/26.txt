====================

Rotorua. 
Still at Level 4 lockdown. 
68 cases today. Growth seems to be slowing down...
Still hoping I can visit my friends before Sep 15.


picking up clickandcollect order from supermarket this morning.
I accidentally placed the order using my countdown account (from when I was rev-eng'ing the api for clickandcollect). I had to explain to the checkout woman why the order was for Mr. FirstName LastName. I had the email with the order number so it wasn't a problem, but I would avoid doing that again. 
We arrived at 10am for pickup. That was too early. Next time we should aim to arrive around 10:40am. 

todo.
- [ ] add supervalue.co.nz to clickandcollect.nz
- [ ] scan pages from 2020 notebook
- [ ] Book airbnb for london (where?)
- [x] order the anker atom iii.
- [x] pick up groceries from countdown at 10am
- [ ] Look into the coursera deutsch course
- [ ] Remind mum about madbutcher online order for delivery tomorrow

Go for a 5km run every day. 

kc.
- [ ] Add option to force a resync of all trades on dasset
- [ ] Finish implementing open order sync (need to upsert rows in db)
