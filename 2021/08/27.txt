==================

morning 5km run around the golf course.

trying to work around stupid dasset api errors.
i think we can just ignore the "failed to cancel order" error?
important thing is to keep track of the available balance.

i worked 4 hours on sunday so i am finishing work early today.

todo.
- [ ] scan pages from 2020 notebook
- [ ] Book airbnb for london (where?)
- [ ] Look into the coursera deutsch course
- [x] Remind mum about madbutcher online order for delivery tomorrow

goals.
- [x] Go for a 5km run every day. 

kc.
- [x] Finish implementing open order sync (need to upsert rows in db)
- [ ] Figure out how to handle "stuck" orders on dasset
