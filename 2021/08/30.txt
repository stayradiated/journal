runn.
- discussing filter engine implementation with rowan, some great feedback about
  making sure the code is readable/maintainable by the whole team.
- [ ] make changes https://github.com/Runn-Fast/runn/pull/6655#issuecomment-908002873
- andria reviewed my blog post!
  * you can read the post at https://github.com/Runn-Fast/runn-api-tutorial/tree/main/toggl_timesheets
  * feedback:
    + [x] In the section `Running the syncing script`, you need a "we" after
          "Now can" in the first sentence.
    + [x] In the section `Looking up a person or project by their external ID`,
          in `const person = findExternalId(people, externalId);` the function
          should be `findItemByReference`.
    + [x] In the section `Updating Actuals in Runn`, you need a , after date in
          the function postActualTimeToRunn().
    + [x] In the function postActualTimeToRunn() , you don't have to re-assign
          the values of options again since you already do it when you call the
          function main(). The function then becomes: 
    
            const response = await runnAPI.post('v0/actuals', {json: options})
            return response.body
    
    + The write up was pretty easy to understand and it worked after the
    postActualTimeToRunn was fixed.
