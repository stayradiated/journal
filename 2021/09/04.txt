====================

- Continuing to clean up room. I have a pretty good idea of all the stuff I
  want to bring with me now.
- Airing out tent in the sun. 
- Airing out the inflatable mat. Found a bunch of mold growing inside it, not
  great. I should have been looking out for that. I've sprayed a little bit of
  vinegar inside and I'm going to leave it in the sun for the next couple days.
- Got a message from `therussdotcom` on reddit, he is interested in my crypto
  project. I need to get a site up asap.
- Out for a bike ride with James. Visiting the Eastwood cafe for a
  clickandcollect coffee.
- Setting up Benji to use wifi. Have moved him into another room so his fan
  doesn't keep me up at night.
- Purchased an Instax Mini 40 camera. I loved my Instax Mini 70, but it doesn't
  take photos anymore :( I think the bulb might need replacing?
- Day 4 of vegetarian diet going well. Cooked cauliflower steaks for dinner.
