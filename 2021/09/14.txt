...

At the Auckland airport. Switching to London time now. 
It's 11:47am (that is 10:47pm in NZ). 
I am super tired, but if I can stay awake for a few more hours, it might help prevent jetlag. 

There are only 5 other passengers waiting to board at the moment. All individuals, of various ages. 
Ooh, make that 7 people. 
One guy has an uber eats bag, that would be quite the delivery from NZ to singapore.
Count is at 9 others
Now 10.
11. 12. 13.
We should be on the plane soon. 
14. I think that's everyone. 
Nope, here comes a family. 18. 
A pair of asian women. 20.
One more woman. 21. 

That's a whole entire plane for just 19 passengers. 
Plenty of elbow room.
