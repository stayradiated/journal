==================

Thoughts:
---------

- Speak a bit louder, making yourself heard and understood is important
- Tempted to go skateboarding -- ideal hire one for a bit. 
  
Plan:
-----

- Plan to wake up at 05:55 and work from 06:00
- First day working async from the UK
- I need to get out for a run
    * Try this route: https://www.plotaroute.com/route/656179
- Work from a cafe

Standup:
--------

Woo! First day working from the other side of Earth!

- Remember to keep an eye on the #intercom channel
- Exctited to have Steven on the team!
- Thinking about how to do deal with feature branch history in git
  * I think I would usually squash+rebase in this case?
- Feature idea, give customers access to the "Blur" button so they can take
  their own screenshots
  * + Privacy conscious
  * - Unlikely to be used often or even realise that the feature exists
- Plan a virtual coffee with Rowan/Priscilla (might be easier to do two vcs
  instead of having to find a time that works with everyone?)

Intercom:

- What happens when a user with a linked person is deleted from an account?
  * the user is deleted, but the person remains
