====================

Why isn't benji online? (don't know, but he's online now)
Where is my sketchbook? (in the front pocket of your backpack, ya goose)
Why isn't reception open yet? (because it's a weekend)

TODO:

- [x] Go for an ~afternoon~ run when the rain has died down a bit
- [x] Make sure backpacker Matt knows I am staying another 2 nights.
- [x] Botober:
  - [x] possumsaurus
  - [x] Rainbow space walrus

I want to visit all the places in the UK

This seems like a good list:

Makes sense to start with Cornwall & Devon

I still haven't had Devonshire cream tea

Narrow list of places to those tat that are good in October/November

Check weather forecast

Would like to:
- Hike
- Cycle
- Sail
- Swim
- Kayak

Ideally plan a trip that Jo also finds exciting
