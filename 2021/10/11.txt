Jo has a cold :(

ST AUSTELL

There aren't many cafes in St Austell, so I'm working from the Costa Coffee.

There is a sandwhich shop called "George's" here, I should grab a sandwhich
from there.

Didn't make it to George's. Picked up a Cheese & Onion Pasty instead.

Still haven't got a good sense of GBP yet.
Quite hard to internalize that a £2.75 coffee is $5.50
That a £3.75 pasty is $7.50
That a £4.50 cream team is $9.00

I quite like the lyrics to Sjowgren's song Seventeen

> If you need a second to breathe
> I'll give you all of my love
> I'll give you all that you need, yeah
> Don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
> Not going nowhere
> I'm not going nowhere, yeah

Walked over to CHARLESTOWN
They have proper cafes here.
Not much signal, but some of the cafes have wifi.
It's a pleasant afternoon.
