CORNISH CREAM TEA

Pretty poor experience at the Tallships Creamery yesterday, with their takeaway
cream tea. 
Hoping to find a better option today.

Short & Strong is a great name for a cafe.
But they were sold out of scones by 1pm, oh well.

Where am I going to sleep tomorrow?
Need to call Jo and see if she is free this weekend, maybe we could go camping?
