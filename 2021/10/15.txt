==================

Checking out of the YHA Penzance this morning.

On a call with Chloe this morning, talking about Hasura.

Catching up with Parents.

Can I avoid using adjectives like "good" and "nice"?  It's not easy.
Challenging to think about what I really mean when I say "this is nice" or "pretty good".

On a train back to St. Austell, going to catch a bus to Mevagissey.
I'll be meeting up with Jo & Excalibur :)
