Forecast is for 30mm of rain today.
That seems like a lot.

Wild Camping in the Dartmoor on Friday night

How am I getting there?
Should be able to catch a bus, just depends on where I want to start walking from.

TODO
----

- [x] Morning Run
- [ ] Take your damp clothes out of your bag and let them dry properly
- [ ] Move from one AirBnB to another. There is a 3 hour gap where I will have
  to look after my own stuff. It will be raining, so I should find somewhere to
  hang about indoors. The Park Lodge cafe is nearby, I will try there.
  - Park Lodge Cafe is not open today :(
  - Walking to the other nearest cafe, Mrs Browns. They do sandwhiches, I think
    I'll get one for lunch. They also have a fantastic selection of slices, but
    I'm not eating any sweet treats for the rest of October.
- [ ] Deep Storage
  - Pick up Tent, Sleeping Bag & Camping Mat
  - Drop Off X, Y & Z
  - Maybe wait until Friday to do this? Or at least wait until Friday to pick
    up my tent, maybe drop stuff off (could pick up the EXIT game?)
