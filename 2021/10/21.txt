====================

Feeling better this morning.

Hoping to meet Jo this afternoon and go for a walk along the coast.

TODO

- [/] Confirm afternoon plans with Jo
  - Jo has to sort her gear out for the weekend, so we'll meet up in the
    evening instead.
- Prepping to go hiking & camping on Friday
  * [x] Purchase OS Map of Dartmoor (OL28, get the waterproof version)
  * [x] Purchase a 2L water from the supermarket
- [x] Pick up a box of lateral flow covid tests from Boots

Tomorrow, catch the Gold bus out to Ivybridge, walk north along Two Moors Way.

Meet Jo at the Samphire Brasserie vegan restaurant for burger, chips and dessert.
Afterwards we stop by the newly reopened Twist board game cafe, it's packed
with people but there is a free table at the back, it's quite loud, but fun atmosphere.

We play 3 rounds of Lost Cities, Jo taking a strong victory in the last round.
We try a game of Carcasonne Castles (the 2 player version) but we don't quite
have enough time to finish the game properly and add up the scores, so we call
it a tie.
