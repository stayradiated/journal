Feeling better this morning.

Hoping to meet Jo this afternoon and go for a walk along the coast.

TODO

- [/] Confirm afternoon plans with Jo
  - Jo has to sort her gear out for the weekend, so we'll meet up in the
    evening instead.
- Prepping to go hiking & camping on Friday
  * [x] Purchase OS Map of Dartmoor (OL28, get the waterproof version)
  * [x] Purchase a 2L water from the supermarket
- [x] Pick up a box of lateral flow covid tests from Boots

Tomorrow, catch the Gold bus out to Ivybridge, walk north along Two Moors Way.
