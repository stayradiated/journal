Waking up next to Jo :)



Checking out of the airbnb at 10:15
walking into town

I leave a dry bag full of gear at Jack n Mols

We have a late breakfast while we are there, Jo gets a veggie bap and orange
juice, I treat myself to a full veggie breakfast and an american coffee.

Jo is not in a hurry to get to London, so she waits for my train to Ivybridge.
We chill in The Ground cafe for a bit.

We say goodbye at Platform 8.
I'm going to miss her.

I arrive in Ivybridge and walk along the road until I get to the entrance of
the Dartmoor National Park.
