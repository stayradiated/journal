Waking up in a tent in Dartmoor, on Hickaton Hill.

Continuing to walk along the Two Moor Ways until I arrive in Holne.
I pass a couple of german(?) guys, who had also been camping in the moor last
night.

In Holne I am pleasantly surprised to see find myself at Tom & Tina's Tearooms.
They are a friendly couple, expecting a child in a few weeks. They serve me a
delicious Devon Cream Tea and I continue on my way.
