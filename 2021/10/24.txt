==================

Rainy morning, feeling out of sorts.
At least I'm in an AirBnB that is dry, warm and has a pleasant aroma (lots of
scented candles).

TODO

- [ ] Collect fabric shaver from Amazon lockbox
- [ ] Make plans to drop gear off at Big Yellow tomorrow morning

Should I get a travel clothesline? 
Would be useful to help dry my clothes after handwashing them.

Photos.
I take so many photos.
I should really publish them.
I've been putting off making a travel website for far too long.
