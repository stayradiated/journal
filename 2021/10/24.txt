Sunday 24 Oct 2021
==================

Rainy morning, feeling out of sorts.
At least I'm in an AirBnB that is dry, warm and has a pleasant aroma (lots of
scented candles).

I would like to extend my booking in Totnes to include Thursday/Friday night,
but I haven't got enough cash to do that right now.

TODO

Should I get a travel clothesline? 
Would be useful to help dry my clothes after handwashing them.

I take so many photos.
I should really publish them.
I've been putting off making a travel website for far too long.




Warren Buffett: “Really Successful People Say No To Almost Everything”
----------------------------------------------------------------------

FROM
https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/warren-buffett-really-successful-people-say-no-to-almost-everything-ab78832ffebc

Key to success in one word: "FOCUS"

> 1. Buffett had Flint write down his top 25 goals on a piece of paper.
> 2. He had him circle the top 5. So far, nothing special.
> 3. he had Flint take the 20 goals he did NOT circle and put them on an
> “avoid-at-all-cost” list. 

> This is the step where you see Buffett’s true
> prioritization genius. At this point, most people would simply just focus on
> the top 5 goals and intermittently work on the rest of the goals. Not Buffett
> though. He advised Flint: “No matter what, these things get no attention from
> you until you’ve succeeded with your top 5.”
