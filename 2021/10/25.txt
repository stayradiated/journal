PLYMOUTH → TOTNES
-----------------

Catching a train out to Totnes this afternoon.

Trying to use cash/coins as much as possible today.

It would be great to schedule virtual coffees with both Iryna and Dan this
week.

I should really order the hip belt for my backpack ($25 USD)

TOTNES
------

Pleasant 5 min walk from train station into the town center.
They get bonus points for sign posting the way.

Stopping at the first cafe I see, Mangetout.
It's got a cute little street path eating area, there is a busker playing some
soothing instrumental guitar music and a book shop alternative.
This cafe does a Roobois Latte, I think it's the first time I've seen this on
the menu?
It's been 10 minutes and so far I am liking totnes.
