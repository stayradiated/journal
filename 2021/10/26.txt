TOTNES
------

Cloudy morning, with G2 rain.

Having a great vegan buffet lunch at Seeds 2 Totnes.
All you can eat for £9.95.

Considering upgrading to an iPhone 13 mini.
Way better battery life and camera.
Maybe if I actually publish a photo journal…

Visited several bookstores, found some books I'd like to read
- Troy, by Stephen Fry
- The Shortest History of England, by James Hawes
   * He has a similar book for Germany as well
- Ikigai, by  Hector Garcia Puigcerver & Francesc Miralles 

Had the BEST lunch at a place called "Seeds 2 Totnes", it's an all-you-can-eat
vegan/veggie buffet, which was new to me, but I love the idea. I hadn't eaten
all morning, so I had a proper appetite ready to go - went back up for seconds,
thirds, fourths. Lots of variety and flavourful dishes.  I stopped before I
felt too full, which is an easy trap with buffets. 5 stars.

Today I set a new personal best on "longest distance ran", in the rain, on a
muddy track up and down and some decent hills. My new record is (only) 10 miles
(16km), planning to work my way up to half marathon distances over November.
