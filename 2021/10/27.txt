That is good news

> Ending quarantine:
> Quarantine at home may be ended early if proof of recovery, proof of
> vaccination or a negative test result is submitted via upload portal of the
> digital registration on entry at https://www.einreiseanmeldung.de. The
> individual link on the registration confirmation (PDF document) should be
> used to upload the proof of recovery, proof of vaccination or a negative test
> result. Quarantine can be ended in each case from the time the negative test
> result is submitted. If you spent time in a high-risk areaprior to entry, the
> relevant test may not be conducted earlier than five days after entry (test
> to release possible from day five following entry). Vaccinated and recovered
> persons can end the quarantine from the time when the proof of vaccination or
> recovery is transmitted via the entry portal.
>
> If the transmission takes place before entry (strongly recommended), no
> quarantine is needed.
