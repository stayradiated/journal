====================

Waking up at 6am.
Research & Development day, building out a prototype of a Project Activity Log.
Working inside until midday.
Walking around Totnes.
Cheese & onion pastie for lunch.
Sitting in a tearoom with a cream tea and reading Sea Fever.
Texting Jacob, he's still happy to host me in Berlin!
Booked a flight over for the 11th November.
Need to re-org my stuff in Plymouth before I head over there.
