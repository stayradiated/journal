====================

A beautiful day in Totnes.
Saturday markets are in full swing.
Sitting in Seeds 2 with a coffee and a notebook

Visiting the Totnes Castle
Great place to defend from

Seeds 2 vegan buffet for lunch (again, it's really good)
Awesome Brownie as a treat for travelling

Catching the 12:53 train to Exeter
Rail Replacement to Honiton
Take train one stop to Axminster
Ride X53 Jurassic Coaster through Lyme Regis to Charmouth
Arrive at 15:53
Not bad, but somehow exhausting

Nigel is a friendly host with a very nice house

Still plenty of sunlight
Walking along the Charmouth beach
A good amount of people about, many searching for fossils
Climbing up the coast path, great views along the beach
Chilling at the top, reading Sea Fever

Chips & Hummus for dinner
Sitting in a sheltered spot on the beach, 
Listening to the latest Gastropod episode on Halloween

Waching ep. 3 of Squid Game
Drinking a beer that Nigel kindly gave me
