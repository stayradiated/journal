===================

Jacob ventured out into the freezing wet (+ sky sniffles of snow) to fetch
bÃ¶rek for breakfast, what a legend.

Quickly packing up my bags and saying goodbye to Alex + Jacob.
If I miss the U8 or S3 train I won't make ito the Berlin Hbf in time.

Taking the ICE train from Berlin to Frankfurt today.
It's a 4 hour journey. Should arrive around 15:00.
