IT IS FREEZING OUTSIDE

- Morning walk to the river Main, stopping for a coffee at the The Holy Cross
  Brewing Society. First place I've been where they also asked for my ID card
  (which I didn't have on me, so I sat outside in the freezing cold).

- Spending most of my time working on KC (which I am now thinking of calling
  Volatile). I really want to get it out there asap.

- Bread with Obatzda
- Dates
- Cherry tomatoes
- Hardboiled Eggs
- Studentenfutter
- Mandarin Oranges
- Apples
- Brocolli with hummus
- Milchreis
