=====================

Catching the train to Leipzig today.

I'm sitting on the train.
There is a man talking on the phone next to me.
A woman approaches and tells him he is too loud.
We are in a regular carriage, not the specially marked "quiet" carriage.
The man continues talking on the phone, but a little quieter.

An hour later, a woman nearby is talking on the phone.
Guy next to me gets up and tells her that she is too loud.
She ends the phone call.

Damn.

WIFI ON THE DB TRAINS
---------------------

DNSSEC issue seems quite common with linux laptops.
Not sure how to confirm that is the case in void linux -- or how to disable
DNSSEC.
