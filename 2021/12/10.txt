75 ml Milch
1 TL Zucker
1 TL Trockenhefe
1/2 TL Salz
250 g + etwas Mehl
1 EL Öl
  75 g Vollmilchjoghurt
1 Ei (Gr. M)

// INGREDIENTS //

Add into pressure cooker:
- 1 cup yellow moong dal, rinsed well (whole green lentils that are split and dehusked)
- 1/2 cup red masoor dal, rinsed well (whole brown lentils that are split and dehusked)
- 4 cups water (+/- based on your preference, you can also add more water at the end)
- 3 green chilies, finely chopped (+/-)
- 2 tomatoes, diced
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1.5 tsp coriander powder
- Salt to taste

Add into tadka/chhonk:
- 1.5 tbsp ghee or avocado oil
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 cup onion, finely diced (+/-)
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/2 inch ginger, grated
- 1/4 tsp red chili powder (+/-)
- 1 dry red chili, break into a couple pieces so the ghee can get inside (optional)

Top with:
- Juice of 1 lime
- Cilantro

// RECIPE //

1.  Add the first eight ingredients to your pressure cooker / Instant Pot /
Mealthy. (If you'd like to soak your lentils for a bit after you rinse them,
you can add them with the water to your pot for 10 min).

2. Set pressure cook settings to sealing, High, Natural Release, 7 minutes (if
you're using a traditional pressure cooker, cook for one whistle).

3. Wait for pressure to release, after 10 min if the pressure valve hasn’t
dropped, manually release the remaining pressure. Check to see if the
consistency is how you like it! You can add another cup of water at this point
to make it thinner. To make it thicker, stir on high heat for a few min.

4. Start on your tadka/chhonk (temper your spices) using a tiny tadka pan or a
small frying pan. Add the ghee and get it very hot.

5. Add the rest of the ingredients gradually - mixing or swirling when needed
to combine. (If your ghee is hot enough this step should be done in 30 seconds
so you don't burn any of the spices.)

6. Top with lime, cilantro, and enjoy with some basmati rice!
