It’s a sky blue sky. Satellites are out tonight.

VALENCIA

A 50 year old German woman is now staying at the AirBnB.
I can't remember her name. Possibly Katrina?
She works 15 hours a day as an anaethetist, but often takes breaks and travels
overseas to work as a translator. She is fluent int sign language, loves to
travel and surf and is looking to buy an appartment in Valencia.
She also is big into fitness and gets paid to advertise the Moa nutritional
supplement on her social media (https://ariixproducts.com/nutrifii-nutritional-supplements/moa/).

Got back into yoga this morning. Day 9 of the Move videos.
It's been 3 days with no yoga and I noticed that I had to really work to get
that forward fold.

LJ is training down to Valencia tomorrow afternoon.

Continuing to practice Deutsch with the BrainScape app.
It's a great app, I'm keen to go through the "Knowledge Rehab" cards as well,
increase my "general knowledge" of the world.
For now the focus is to cram as many chunks as I can so I am ready for the A1 exam tomorrow.

Trying to keep the costs down by not having to pay for Open Exchange Rates.
Problem is the free tier only supports converting to USD.
I need to know the AUD ↔ NZD exchange rate. 

I assume that exchange rates are tightly controlled to avoid arbitrage.
So in theory NZD → USD → AUD should be the same as NZD → AUD, right?

Let's check with xe.com

100,000 AUD → → → → → → → → →  105,910.30 NZD
100,000 AUD → 72,044.157 USD → 105,910.31 NZD

100,000 NZD → → → → → → → → →  94,424.09 AUD
100,000 NZD → 68,021.443 USD → 94,424.086 NZD

Not bad!
