====================

MAD MAD MADRID.

Didn't sleep too well. Quite nosiy, had to put earplugs in.

Need to see a doctor about this cyst behind my ear.
Should ask LJ which service she uses to get an online appointment.
Tomorrow, going to give these folks a call: https://www.unidadmedica.com/
Cysts aren't covered by my travel insurance.

Setting up the retro meeting for Feb 2022.
Shared with the team, so people can start adding talking points head of time.

So many places to checkout here.

I reckon I could make a pretty good flat whie.
Still keen to learn how to do that.
