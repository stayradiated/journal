===================

Dasset has finally made it possible to make automated deposits. How good!

LJ is catching a train back to Barcelona this afternoon.
Seeing her off at the Atocha Renfe station.

Visiting Zero Point Espresso.
Pretty good chai latte and banana cake.

Need to go for a run this afternoon.
