TRAIN from BARCELONA to BILBAO.
           08:50        15:22

Waking up at 06:40 to slack notifications.

The cafeteria on the train doesn't accept my card.
Fortunately had enough coins to get a coffee and a sandwich.

Bilbao is beautiful. Glad to see it on such a great day.
Thursday

Oddity: fellow using a pram to push a full sized fridge around the city, pram was barely holding together. 

Highlight: Bilbao is a gorgeous city, clean, green, modern + a great river right through the center.
