BILBAO.

It's actually been raining a little this morning! I haven't seen much rain at
all while in Spain. Only that one afternoon in Barcelona.

Technically I should have the day off (Auckland Anniversary Day).
I'm going to work today and take Friday off.

Having a Cafe con Leche and Pain au Chocolat at the fancy cafe down the road (Cafe
Iruna).

Wasn't there a big debate in France over the naming of Pain au Chcolat?  Hmm,
seems like parts of the country prefer Chocolatine, but seems the debate wasn't
that serious.

Thinking about buying a bike.
Was considering one of those folding bikes (like Brompton), but they are very
expensive and there are many trade-offs just to have it fold.  The main reason
I want to have a folding bike, is that it is easier to fly with and travel on
buses/trains. However, it might be worth just getting a regular bike and paying
a bit more to transport it.
