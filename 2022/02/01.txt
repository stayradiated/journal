BILBAO

Sitting in a cafe (Mischocole) with the best hot chocolate of my life, working
on a fun programming challenge to generate gigabytes of fake data while
watching people in cars stuck in gridlock.

When you are stuck in traffic, you haven't got many options. Especially if it's
a one lane one way road with cars in front and behind you. The traffic curves
off around the corner and around another corner and another corner. Horns are
honked, but nothing can be done.

A few people get up and walk around to see what the problem is, they come back
a few minutes later and they don't look happy.  I think the best thing to do is
just sit back and relax. Call up your mates and have a laugh, you aren't going
anywhere soon, the sooner you accept that the better. Might as well leave the
car there and go and get a coffee.

20 minutes pass and the cars are finally free.
