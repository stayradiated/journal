BILBAO

The clouds have left, blue skies are back, baby!

Travelling via Bus to San Sebastian today.
Need to get myself to the bus stop by 13:15.

Packing up and checking out of the airbnb.
Working from the ARVO cafe, fantastic coffee and AÃ§ai bowl (smoothie with
banana, granola and coconut).

I will need to sort out a new SIM card for when I leave the EU.

My belly is on fire.
