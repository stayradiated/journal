====================

I've been having muscle pain in my left foot for the past 2 days now.
Most likely caused by that 15 mile run on Sundayâ€¦

Catching up with parents this morning, they are well.

I would like to have a long weekend.
Maybe go for a walk in the mountains.
Or along the coast: https://www.komoot.com/smarttour/3991849

Need to book a flight out of spain for next week.

Running along the San Sebastian beach, such a great feeling.
Plus a quick swim in the water, extremely refreshing.
I should do this every day.

Found an amazing restaurant to have lunch at: The Yellow Deli.
Very friendly staff, trying one of their sandwhiches and a Lima Matte.
And they are open from 6am to 1am!
I will have to leave a 5 star review.

I could see myself living in San Sebastian.
Learn how to speak German, Spanish and French.
