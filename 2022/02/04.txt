==================

SAN SEBASTIAN.

Didn't sleep very well last night.
Pretty sure that Yerba Mate I had with lunch yesterday was chock full of
caffeine, because my brain was running at 2x speed solving the problems of the
universe while I despearately pleaded with it to go to sleep.

Having a little coffee and croissant at Old Town Coffee. Great little cafe (I
found it via the Coffee Trip app).

Bought a new little wallet from a local store, it has as anchor painted on it.

Practicing drawing the sea.

Quite like the look of the Ucon Acrobatics bags.
