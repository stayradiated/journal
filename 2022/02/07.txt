DONOSTIA, SAN SEBASTIAN

Bit of a late start to the day. Sorting out my trip to Croatia.

Watching a bit of Sean Locke on YouTube, more Deutschkurs (learning about all
the irregular perfect present verbs, gesehen, eingekauft, gedacht, etc),
followed by a bit of morning yoga.

Finally heading out at midday for a coffee & croissant at Old Town Coffee.
It's been raining this morning, only lightly (about a 2 on the George scale),
but it seems the locals love an execuse to get out the umbrella.

I wonder if the weather will clear up this afternoon, that's what usually
happens here, a bit grey and wet in the morning, lovely blue sunny skies in the
afternoon.

Planning to get my hair tidied up today at Kur2 barbers.
