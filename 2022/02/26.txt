By Gum!
Would be a great name for chewing gum. 

7 mile run around the streets of Zagreb. 

Learning about the history of Ukraine.

Going to have a tasty burek for lunch. 

It was snowing! Snow flakes falling from the heavens. Always a treat. 
Flippin' cold out here now though. 

Quite windy as well. Running through the woods, I was worried the trees might topple over. Didn't happen though.
