Snowflakes are drifitng down from the skies this morning!
I went out for a forest walk, short pone call with parents, making a coffee.
Hands freezing on the walk back.

March 13th → James birthday

I have bread.
I now have toast. French toast.
Noice.

Someone once told me about a drink called the White Pearl.
I'm pretty sure it was Annabel from Picton.
It's just hot water and milk, but it's really good.
Anyway, I really like it people invent names for things. 
I should do that.

In TypeScript, how to get the keys of an object type whose values are of a given type?
======================================================================================

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54520676/in-typescript-how-to-get-the-keys-of-an-object-type-whose-values-are-of-a-given

   type KeysMatching<T, V> = {[K in keyof T]-?: T[K] extends V ? K : never}[keyof T];

   type Thing = {
     a: string
     b: number
     c: boolean
   }

   KeysMatching<Thing, string> → 'a'
   KeysMatching<Thing, string | number> → 'a' | 'b'

   Pick<Thing, KeysMatching<Thing, boolean>> → { c: boolean }
