  * who can make changes (admin/editor/superuser)
  * which rows can be edited
- env vars
  * use `env-var` library
  * single file named `env.ts` in the root directory that holds all env variables
- logging
  * Should we just use `debug`
  * Options like `pino` which log as JSON
- errors
  * Throwing errors vs. returning errors
  * Explicit error handling when we return errors
  * Typescript compiler can help us
