March Learning & Development day: setup Handover bot

Why don't we use the local disk to persist `node_modules`?
Is there a reason I have it set to store in a docker volume?
It would be quite useful to share `node_modules` between the Ruby app and the Node app.

Malade
------

by Katherine Mansfield

The man in the room next to mine
Has got the same complaint as I
When I wake in the night I hear him turning
And then he coughs
And I cough
And he coughs again —
This goes on for a long time —
Until I feel we are like two roosters
Calling to each other at false dawn
From far away hidden farms
