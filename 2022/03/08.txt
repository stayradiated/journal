===================

Waking up at 6am.
Lying in bed reading Ben Thompson's thoughts on Big Tech sanctions in Russia.

Morning walk around the Old Town.
I'll need to get up early to see the crack of dawn.

Catching up with Rowan, he is in Canberra.
Having issues with the internet cutting in and out.
The wi-fi in the room isn't great for video calls.

Out for a midday run.
Went for another half-marathon distance - about just over 13 miles. 
Not bad. Quite comfortable with this distance.
I'd like to try and hit 20 miles this month. Just need to ease into it.
Maybe next week we try for 18 miles.

Lot of people walking around with flowers today.
Is that normal? Or is there some Croatia valentines day I don't know about?
Oh, it's International Women's Day.
Is that like forgetting someone's birthday? I should be more aware of what
events are celebrated each day.

International Men's Day is on the November 18th.

> In 2018, a small group promoted men's day in New Zealand.

That sounds about right.

What about the pigeons? Do they get a day?

> International Pigeon Day on June 13th.

Oh, we good then.
