=====================

Lay in bed for an extra half hour, need to get the courage to face the cold floor.
Went for a walk along the Old Town walls, beautiful morning light.
Reading a bit of "Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill". Such a great way to
write a biography.

Helping out Andria debug adding Userflow.js to the app.

Having a coffee at the Caffe Bar Forum.

Hummus, Brocolli, Carrot, Cheese, Croissant, Apple & Banana for lunch.
Pizza for dinner.
Scoffing a box of Mcvitties chocolate digestives.

Keen to try this song:

Breaking character.
Sitting outside a cafe with a beer (Pilsner).
Note: 0.5L is too much.
