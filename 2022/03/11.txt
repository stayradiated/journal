Friday 11 Mar 2022
==================

Starting the day proper by getting out of bed at exactly 5:57am.
Taking the guitar out to sunrise point and practicing my chords.
Quite chilly, but I had my thermos and a mug of mate to keep me warm.

Starting the work day from Caffe Novi.
Zadar is such a beautiful old town, I love all the bricks.

@ 44.114222, 15.227564
In the People's Square, the centre of the Old Town, there are two cafes on opposite sides.
Both fill the square with a grid of tables and chairs.
As the day passes, the sunlight moves from one side of the square to the other.
In the morning, everyone enjoys a coffee at the North side cafe, no one sits in the shade.
In the afternoon, the sun has moved, and the South side cafe attracts the customers.

I love how every caffe in Croatia gives you a complementary glass of water with
your coffee. Not so keen on the two packets of sugar though.

Thinking about porting Volatile to Remix, just to try it out.

AARON'S PIZZA DOUGH RECIPIE
---------------------------

> So it depends on how soon you want to use it. Most recipes recommend you let
> it proof in the fridge for at least a day. In that case I do 500g flour, 300g
> water, 4g yeast and 12g salt.
>
> In this case I was in a hurry and wanted it for lunch so I did more yeast and
> 65% hydration let it bulk ferment for just two hours
>
> There's a great app called PizzApp that figures all this out for you. You
> just punch in your variables 
> 
> But I have to say, the most important thing I've discovered so far is 00
> flour. All the pizza hobbyists recommend it but I could never find it. Found
> it at Good For in Wellington (bulk grocer), and it makes a massive
> difference. 
>
> Semolina is good for putting on the peel to help with the launch because the
> dough won't absorb it. I'd like to try that sometime.
