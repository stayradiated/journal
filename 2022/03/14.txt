==================

My face skin is a bit peely this morning, I'm very happy I picked up some
sunblock yesterday (surprisingly hard to find, do Croatians tend not to use
sunblock?).

Found a music shop in Zadar, purchsed a guitar strap for 30HRK.
Now I can play the guitar standing up!

Moving from Zadar to Dugi Otok (long island) this afternoon.
Catching the 15:00 ferry, it's only $5 and takes 45min to get there.

Turns out the ferry isn't sailing direct to Sali, it goes to Zaglav, the town
next door. Fortunately, my AirBnB hosts are awesome and offered to give me a
left from the terminal, saving me having to make my own way.

Sali is a gorgeous town, already considering to stay here a bit longer.
5pm, sitting outside the Martimo cafe with an orange juice, watching the sun
fall behind the mountain tops.

      if an error is encountered during the deploy, we could log something

      Explain my reasoning
- [ ] Rails Upgrade
