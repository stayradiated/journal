SALI
----

- Maritimo: caffe and bar, friendly waitress, popular with the locals
- Tommy: local supermarket, well stocked, but lacking in the cheese department

Planning to visit the local restaurant for dinner.
There are only 2 open at the moment, Garoful and Trapula.

FOOD
----

Lunch: scrambled eggs on toast, with a slice of cheddar and cherry tomatoes.
       + plain yoghurt with banana

Dinner: garlic, onion, soy sauce, rice, mushroom, brocolli, carrot, beans

DOCKER
------

I have finally finished updating the apps in my stayradiated/desktop image.
It would be handy to have a way to automatically do this for me.

- Find latest version of each app
- Run container-diff find out what changed, update exports
- Build each app and alert on which ones have failed

PHONE
-----

Might be time for a new phone soon.

My iPhone SE (2016) has several issues:

- very short battery life
- keep maxing out storage (32GB)
- can be a bit slow sometimes
- mute switch can sometimes trigger accidentally

New issue: volume always return to 0%, increasing volume is futile


CROATIAN
--------

Can I have a coffee with milk

"...the crucial point isn't that it's wrong to spend your time relaxing... it's
that the distracted person isn't really choosing at all. Their attention has
been commandeered by forces that don't have their highest interests at heart."
