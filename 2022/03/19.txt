Listening to all the alphabet songs this morning.
The English alphabet song is pretty great, it rhymes well and you can sing
along with the "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" tune.
French, German, Spanish have great pronounciation, but don't rhyme when sung to
the same tune.
Russian alphabet is intense.

Love that Fmaj7 chord

Reading about "A Spoonful of Sugar" song.
Apparently the Polio vaccine was given orally, injected into sugar cubes.
Also discovered Andy Weir's Cheshire Crossing graphic novel.
Ernest Rutherford is a champ.

Damn, Rembrandt could draw. I love the way he etches.
