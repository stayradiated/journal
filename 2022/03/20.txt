==================

What is Earth but an island in the ocean of the universe?

Bought some drawing pencils, nothing fancy, just a HB, B and B2.
Going to practice skething with pencil for the next few weeks.

I want to get good at sketching landscapes.

Exercises:

(from https://draftscapes.com/3-proven-exercises-to-improve-your-landscape-drawing/)

- Timed sketches
  * Arrange the 5 photographs in sequential order randomly, one through five.
    Starting with the first photograph, give yourself a full 5 minutes to
    sketch the scene. Set a timer to keep you honest. Once the 5 minutes are
    up, put your pen or pencil down and move to the next page.
- Repetition
  * Position a leaf in front of you. Take 1 page of your sketchbook and quickly
    (within 20-30 seconds) draw the overall form of the leaf. Repeat the same
    small sketch 24 more times so that you have a total of 25 leaves on your
    page. 
  * After the initial 25 sketches are done, move the leaf to a new location
    along with a new orientation (rotate it, flip it over, or stand it up
    against something). Repeat 25 sketches on a new page. Keep moving the leaf
    and sketching until you have a total of 4 pages and 100 leaves drawn. This
    should take no more than 1 hour to complete, but you can take short breaks
    in between pages.
- Daily Sketching
  * Dedicate only 5 minutes a day, every day, for 1 month (30 days). For those
    5 minutes, you should be in a comfortable enjoyable place doing something
    you would normally have been doing even if you weren’t sketching. The three
    examples I will use are grabbing a cup coffee, taking your dog for a walk,
    and listening to music.
  * Whatever activity you might enjoy, take 5 minutes while you are doing it
    and simply sketch something related. It can be anything you that wish –
    sketching a group of people at the coffee shop, sketching your dog while
    he/she runs through the park, or perhaps sketching an abstract concept of
    how the music makes you feel.
