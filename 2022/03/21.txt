To live is to risk it all, otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.
- Rick Sanchez

I should take bigger risks. 

Good idea to help prevent damage to my laptop: sew some thick padding material to the internal bottom of my backpack. Will also give it more structure and stop it sagging so much.
