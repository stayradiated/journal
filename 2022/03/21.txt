I should take bigger risks. 

TRAVEL DAY
----------

Travelling from Sali → Zaglav → Zadar → Šibernik.
Will I make it?

Dugi Otok bus timetable
Leaves from Sali at 10:00, but from where exactly?

→ No sign of the 10am bus, vanished into the aether.
  Ended up walking for 40 minutes around the coast to Zaglav.
  Quite a good day for it.

The ferry arrived at 10:15, boarded at 10:30.

TODO
----

- [/] Catch bus to Zaglav → walked
- [x] Catch ferry to Zadar
- [ ] Catch bus to Šibernik

Good idea to help prevent damage to my laptop: sew some thick padding material
to the internal bottom of my backpack. Will also give it more structure and
stop it sagging so much.
