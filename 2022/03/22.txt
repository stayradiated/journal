===================

My room in Šibernik has a beautiful view of the old town and river.

Looking forward to Daylight Savings.
The sun rises here at 06:00 in the morning, about the same time I wake up.
I like getting up before the crack of dawn, but I don't like waking up before 6am.

The Greek embassy in Croatia is in Zagreb.
But do I need to go there in person?

Can I e-mail the Consulate of Greece in New Zealand?
