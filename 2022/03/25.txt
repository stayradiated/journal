- [x] Bus ticket & Return

Caught the earliest bus out to Krka, which left at 11:15. I got off at the
first stop, thinking it was Lazovac, but we weren't quite there yet, so I ended
up walking for 20 minutes along the road to get to the park. 

Reception was in a large car park, surrounded by souvenir stores, cafes,
restaurants, none of which were open. 

I paid for my entry ticket and was shown the way to get to the park, a steep
path covered in rocks of all shapes and sizes, winding 875m down to the water.

There was a woman ahead of me, as I passed her I commented on how the roughness
of the trail, and how much of an authentic experience it is compared to the
cliché shops and car-park at the start of the track.

I was expecting to just pass her by and continuing the track by myself, but she
walked with me and we started talking about Croatia, travel, covid, waterfalls,
etc. We made it around the whole walking trail together.



Back at the car park she offered to give me a lift into Šibenik, as the next
bus was 2 hours away. She dropped me off near my AirBnB, we exchanged numbers
on WhatsApp and then did that cute french thing where they kiss each other on
the cheek, "La Bise".

ŠIBENIK
-------

I felt like spending the rest of the afternoon by the water, so I grabbed my
guitar and walked down to Petrus Beach. I swam around in the water for a few
minutes, embracing the cold, trying a few laps of front crawl, finally just
floating on my back for a bit.

It was quite pleasant to just sit on the beach in the sun, very relaxing. I
dried myself off, changed back into warm clothes and ate the food I had bought
for Krka.

As the sun slowly set behind the mountains, I got my guitar out and practiced a
few different songs. I'm still trying to get my F chord down, particually the G
→ F transition.
