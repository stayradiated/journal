Shirts

Size S
Slim Fit
White is really bright
Oxford blue is good, buy a bit much with the blue shorts
Slate grey works well
Bit tight around the shoulders when sitting down, I wonder if a merino shirt would be a little stretchier
Black is surprisingly good
S
A wool shirt please. 


When I visit Marika in France, bring her some gifts from Greece. She really likes feta cheese with red pepper, kinda spicy. 




Dinner out at Restaurant Pjat. I love a solid wooden chair and these chairs are the heaviest I've ever seen. 

The waiter suggests a Croatian wine, name of RAK - from a local vineyard 10km from Šibenik. A subtle taste, weightless in the mouth. 

A thick tumbler glass feels great in the hand, makes drinking tap water feel majestic. 

I have ordered a Croatian stew, Brudet, no idea what I am in for, but it should be tasty. Damn that was good, a seafood stew served in a thick rich broth, along with polenta and bread.
