Little Bobby would be a good name for a sailboat.

Shirts
------

- Size S
- Slim Fit
- White is really bright
- Oxford blue is good, but a bit much with the blue shorts
- Slate grey works well
- Bit tight around the shoulders when sitting down, I wonder if a merino shirt
  would be a little stretchier
- Black is surprisingly good
- A wool shirt please. 

When I visit Marika in France, bring her some gifts from Greece. She really
likes feta cheese with red pepper, kinda spicy. 

Restoran Pjat
-------------

Dinner out at Restaurant Pjat. I love a solid wooden chair and these chairs are
the heaviest I've ever seen. 

The waiter suggests a Croatian wine, name of RAK - from a local vineyard 10km
from Šibenik. A subtle taste, weightless in the mouth. 

A thick tumbler glass feels great in the hand, makes drinking tap water feel
majestic. 

I have ordered a Croatian stew, Brudet, no idea what I am in for, but it should
be tasty. Damn that was good, a seafood stew served in a thick rich broth,
along with polenta and bread.
