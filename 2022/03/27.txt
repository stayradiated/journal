DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME
--------------------

> The practice of advancing clocks (typically by one hour) during warmer months
> so that darkness falls at a later clock time.
>
> The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in the
> spring ("spring forward"), and to set clocks back by one hour in autumn
> ("fall back") to return to standard time.
>
> The idea of aligning waking hours to daylight hours to conserve candles was
> first proposed in 1784 by US polymath Benjamin Franklin. 
>
> In 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson proposed the
> idea of changing clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington
> Philosophical Society, as he wanted to have more daylight hours to devote to
> collecting and examining insects.
>
> DST is generally not observed near the Equator, where sunrise and sunset
> times do not vary enough to justify it.
>
> Conversely, it is not observed at some places at high latitudes, because
> there are wide variations in sunrise and sunset times and a one-hour shift
> would relatively not make much difference. 

> George Vernon Hudson (1867 â€“ 1946) was a British-born New Zealand
> entomologist and astronomer. Hudson is credited with proposing the modern
> daylight saving time.
