How are you going?

Has Sven heard back about the grant for his landscaping business?

3 weeks away
Zadar, staying in the old town, wondeful, no cars! Plus they have a sea organ!
Uglijan, so many olive trees. 
Dugi Otok, island life is great
Å ibernik
Krka, gorgeous waterfalls

So many cats! I must see a dozen cats a day.
