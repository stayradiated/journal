LOCATION
--------

Staying in šibernik for another week.
I like it here.

Moving into Hostel Splendido today.
It has quite good reviews, let's see how splendid it really is.

Going to check-in to Splendido at 2pm, then go and move my bags from the
AirBnB.

...

Checked-in sucessfully. Place is great, I've got a whole 4 bed dorm to myself
for only NZD $22 a night.

Met another french woman, name of Charlotte, who is also travelling around
Croatia. She is heading to Krka tomorrow, though she is convinced it will rain.
If it does she can have my umbrella. 

FRIENDS
-------

Going to try catching up with Kelsey today.
What time tho? What's a good time to call someone? Is there such a thing?
How about 11am. That's a time.
Swoosh. It's 11:30am. It's lunch time now.
How about 3pm? That's another time.
Oh, she is at the office. She'll call me back later.

Kelsey called around 8pm, we had a great chat, it's always worth talking with
friends. I should do it more often.

TODO
----

- [ ] Prisma/Zapatos → how do we get the audit log to record user & account IDs?

- [x] Send e-mail to Greek embassy in Canberra.
  - Trying to get up at 5:30am to call them is to difficult right now.

- [ ] Watch Ruth's video on Permissions (34 min)
