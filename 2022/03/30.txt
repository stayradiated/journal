Talking with Charlotte (25) at Giro caffe this morning.
Discussing Vipassana meditation and her experience at a 10 day silent retreat!

This silent retreat idea interests me, sounds like the sort of thing Tim Ferris
would do.
Yep. https://tim.blog/2021/08/18/random-show-kevin-rose-nft-crypto/

Foods that Charlotte recommends:

- Napolitanke (Neapolitan wafers)
- Zagorski štrukli
- Black Risotto (Arròs negre)
