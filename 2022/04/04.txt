Today I find a Croatian sailing school. 

Ivana recommends one in Murter, I need to follow up with her, she said she would ask her friend Sasha if he is still doing courses. 



Sharing the dorm with a German woman from Dortmund, mother of 3, eldest is Peter Meocec, 33, a very talented pianist. She is very proud of him and loves to listen to his music when falling asleep.
