==================



Sharing the dorm with a German woman from Dortmund, mother of 3, eldest is
Peter Meocec, 33, a very talented pianist. She is very proud of him and loves
to listen to his music when falling asleep.


TIL about Schlager music.
I've heard a lot of these songs before, but I didn't know it had a name.

- Petula Clark - Sailor
- Engelbert Humperdinck - Release Me
- Roy Orbsion - Only the Lonely

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music
>
> a style of European popular music that is generally a catchy instrumental
> accompaniment to vocal pieces of pop music with simple, happy-go-lucky, and
> often sentimental lyrics.
>
> Typical Schlager tracks are either sweet, sentimental ballads with a simple,
> catchy melody or light pop tunes. Lyrics typically center on love,
> relationships, and feelings.

Man, my head hurts.
It's like a hangover, but I didn't drink anything? I did have two sips of the
Plum Schnapps that was going around. What's the minimum amount of alcohol you
need to get a hangover? I think that most of the symptoms of hangovers are from
poor sleep -- and I didn't sleep very well last night, so that could be it.

Sailing
-------

Today I find a Croatian sailing school. 

Ivana recommends one in Murter, I need to follow up with her, she said she
would ask her friend Sasha if he is still doing courses. 

Know the basics, names of the boats, general idea of what the sail

Looking at the "Basics of Sailing" course for 16.04.-21.04.2022. ~$800 NZD.
