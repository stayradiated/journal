Watch
-----

Found a place in šibernik that can replace my watch battery.
However, the new battery does not seem to help me - my phone can not detect my watch.
Going to try syncing with my old iPhone.
I don't care if I can't sync, I just want to set the time.
My watch is stuck at 07:25, rather an aesthetic time.
