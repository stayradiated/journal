TRAVEL DAY.
Time to pack up my gear, I'm catching the 14:00 bus to Primošten today.
It's only 30 min away from Šibernik.

> Primošten is a village and municipality in Šibenik-Knin County, Croatia. It
> is situated in the south, between the cities of Šibenik and Trogir, on the
> Adriatic coast.
>
> In the past, Primošten was situated on the islet close to the mainland.
> During the Turkish invasions in 1542 the islet was protected by the walls and
> towers and a draw bridge connected it to the mainland. When the Turks
> retreated, the draw bridge was replaced by the causeway and in 1564 the
> settlement was named Primošten after the Croatian verb primostiti (to
> bridge). 
>
> It is built on a hill and is dominated by the parish church of St. George
> which was built in 1485 and restored in 1760 close to the local graveyard
> from which a unique view spreads to the sea and the surroundings. 
>
> Primošten is famous for its huge and beautiful vineyards. A photo of the
> vineyards of Primošten hung in the UN center in New York. Apart from its
> vineyards, Primošten is also known for the traditional donkey race that takes
> place there every summer. The largest beach in Primošten is called Raduča,
> and its smaller part, Mala Raduča, is voted one of the 10 most beautiful
> beaches in Croatia. The area's vineyards are currently under consideration to
> become a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Walking around the streets with my guitar, strumming away.
