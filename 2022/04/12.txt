- [ ] Watch latest update about Freelancers: https://threads.com/34422203466

- [o] Threads
  - [x] Is there a better way we can do asHasuraUser()? It's not obvious what it is for or when to use it.
  - [x] How should we organize helper functions for interacting with the database? For example, where should getStandardRateCard live?
  - [x] Is it better to pass a prisma instance around, or have a single instance that can be accessed globally?
  - [ ] How should we provide session information to the helper functions?
  - [ ] How should we implement action handlers -- as functions or as fastify routes -- how does this affect testing?
  - [ ] Best practices around error handling with Prisma (particularly error codes)
- [ ] Liam's suggestions:
  - [x] (framework? )fastify  + ecosystem vs other
  - [x] routing
  - [x] validation approach
  - [x] initial folder structure
  - [x] prisma + hasura (asHasuraUser)
  - [ ] testing approach
