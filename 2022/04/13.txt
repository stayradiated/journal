=====================

Catching a bus to Brodarica this morning.

In Croatia, they don't have bus timetables. Similar to the weather, they have
bus forecasts.

To catch a bus, you only need to know where to wait. This is harder than it
sounds, as bus stops are typically an unmarked spot on the side of the road.

To make it even more difficult, there are decoy Bus stops set up to trap tourists.

Why wait for a ferry, when you can just get a lift with a boat guy?

Drat! Left my pencil case back on the mainland…

Fortunately Maja and Ivana still haven't arrived, they got it back for me.
Turns out the Ferry people had picked it up, thinking it was left by one of the
schoolkids.

Working with Maja, Ivana and their NGO group to clean up a pond on the island.
Trimming trees, pulling out shrubs, just giving the place a good tidy up.
Pretty soon we had a massive pile of branches. There were set a side and a fire
was started to slowly burn them up.
We had trained firemen with us and official permission, so it was legit.
Plus these funny yellow backpacks that squirt water - perfect for a watergun
fight.

Afterwards, we had a fantastic lunch - Krapanj Plate - octopus pasta. Delicious!
