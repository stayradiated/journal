Travel Day!

Primošten → Šibenik → Jezera

- Catching the bus to Šibenik @ 13:10. It was on time!
- No buses running to Jezera :(
- Called up Taxi Oscar and he picked me up within 15 minutes.
  * Great chatting to him on the drive to Jezera.
  * He lives in Šibenik and has his own Olive Tree grove.

I love how I can just ask for a "small beer" and the caffe staff just say OK!
