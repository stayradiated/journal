Sunday 17 Apr 2022
==================

Today is day 1 of my Basic of Sailing course!

Starting with theory taught by Miša.
Plus a couple hours on the boat, but not detaching from the Mooring lines.

It's very windy today, strong 25 knot winds.
Trying to fold a Jib Sail is a real challenge, even with 6 people!

Points of Sail
--------------

With True Wind from 0° 

- 0°    No Go Zone
- 45°   Close Hauled
- 90°   Reaching
- 135°  Broad Reaching
- 180°  Run

- Bear Away: moving away from the wind (i.e. Reaching to Broad Reaching)
- Luff Up: moving towards the wind (i.e. Reaching to Close Hauled)

- Tack: turning across the wind
- Gybe: turning opposite the wind

Sails
-----

- Sloop
- Bermuda Rig
- Main & Head Sail
- Headsail
  * Hanked On
  * Loose Luffed
  * Roller Furled
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_furling

Standing Rigging
----------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_rigging

- Forestay
- Backstay
- Shrouds (used with Spreaders for extra strength)

Boat
----

- Bow: front of the boat
- Stern: rear of the boat

- Port: left side of the boat
- Starboard: right side of the boat

- Pulpit: solid rail at bow
- Pushpit: solid rail at stern
- Lifeline: wire line connecting Pulpit and Pushpit
  * supported by solid Stanchions
- Toe Rail: solid board around edge of boat to stop gear falling out

- Helm: Steering Wheel (turns boat in same direction)
- Tiller: Stick that controls Rudder (turns boat in opposite direction)

Parts of the Sail
-----------------

- Points:
  * Head (top of the sail)
  * Tack (corner attacking the wind)
  * Clew (opposite to Tack)
- Edges:
  * Luff  (between Head and Tack)
  * Leach (between Head and Clew)
  * Foot  (between Tack and Clew)
- Telltales
- Batterns: solid material reinforcing Main Sail 
- Cringle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cringle)
  * A cringle is an eye through which to pass a rope. 

Reefing Main Sail
-----------------

- 1st/2nd/3rd Reef Cringles
  * Each is made up of a Tack and Clew side Cringle
- Rams Horn hooks hold the Tack side Cringle
- Lines running to the Cockpit keep Clew side Cringle in place

Types of Head Sails
-------------------

Because this boat has a Hanked On Headsail, to reduce the Sail Area we need to
replace each with a different size sail.

(If it was a Roller Furled head sail, we could just roll up the Sail a bit).

- Genoa: largest sail, big enough to overlap with Main Sail, lighter material
- Jib / Flock / Working Jib: medium sail
- Storm Jib: smallest sail, very tough material

Essential Knots
---------------

- Bowline
  * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline)
  * attaching Jib Halyards and Jib Sheets to Jib
  * "the virtues of being both easy to tie and untie"
- Clove Hitch
  * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clove_hitch)
  * attaching Fenders to Lifeline
- Reef Knot
  * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_knot)
  * tying down Folded Sail and Sail Cover
- Sheet Knot
  * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_bend)
  * joining two lines of different diameter or rigidity.
