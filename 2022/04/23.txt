======================

Saw my first frog! It was just sitting in the middle of the road. Very well camouflaged, the pattern on it’s skin resembling a stony pathway. It was larger than I expected. I also wasn’t moving - is that normal? I wish I had stopped to have a closer look, but I had all my gear with me and was late to  my taxi. 

It’s another Travel Day!

Jezera ➝ Pirovac ➝ Sinenik ➝ Split ➝ Vis

- Taxi to Pirovac: 135 HRK
- Bus to Split: 61 HRK
- Ferry to Vis: 49 HRK
- Bus to Komiža: 20 HRK

Damn, Split is full of tourists. 

I watched a woman drop a plastic bottle of juice into the sea. I couldn’t believe what I had seen. Why?! What is the appropriate response here? The bottle could not be retrieved by hand from the wharf. Saying nothing is not good enough. Next time, I need to walk up to her and say “Excuse Me! It’s not OK to throw your trash in the ocean, please never do that again. There is a bin right there”.

Friends

Tattoo idea I’ve been thinkingg about recently: waves

- aquarius symbol (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(astrology))
- water, sea, ocean, sailing
- analog lfrequency, sound, music
- rise and fall, high and lows, ups and downs
- loop, patterns, time

Is it to simple? Wondering if I could find an original way to draw it. 

Even better, combine it with another meaningful symbol. 

Weather
———————

It is too hot for winter socks and long pants. 65°F. 

I should sort out a summer wardrobe. 

I would like to try a merino long sleeved shirt with some shorts.


Vis
———

Far more mountainous than I had expected. 

Very beautiful. 

I went for an afternoon swim at the beach. A few sunbathers out, but no  one else in the water. Fantastic temperature. Just watch out for the sea urchins and slippery rocks. 

Quite a few noisy kids around. I don’t mind kids having fun, but the sound they make was irritating my brain. I’m sure this is an age issue, I don’t remember ever feeling like this as a child. 

While shopping for groceries, A kid roller-skated passed me into the store! I was impressed and a bit jealous. I wonder how people would react if a Grown Up did that.
