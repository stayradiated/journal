Sunday 24 April 2022
====================

A quiet morning. 

Woke up 2am. Probably too much dark chocolate before bed. 

Up at 8:30am. Keen to go for a run but it was slightly raining. Should clear by midday. 

- [x] What days do I need to book accomodation in Jezera? None, I will be on the boat for 6 nights.
