Afternoon run.
Afternoon swim.

Bought some swimming goggles!
Keen to try them out tomorrow.

RUNN
----

One thing I'd like to try is running the `yarn install` in Github Actions, so
we cache the `node_modules` folder between builds. It should speed up the build
time significantly.

- [x] Create Github Project for Node Server with cards for each piece
  - Target: deploy to production by the end of May
