====================

Plan for Saturday:
- Check out of AirBnB
- Catch bus from Trogir to Pirovac
- Pay taxi to get me to Jezera

Plan for Friday:
- Back in Jezera in the afternoon

Options:
Hitch a ride with someone to Zagreb

Uh oh.
Gonna need to get myself a booster shot in Croatia.

Plan: call the Split health service, see if they can help me.
Backup Plan: get vaccinated in Zagreb

Visited the local pharmacy in Trogir.
The woman at the counter didn't know where to get vaccinated.
She had a look online, found a place in Split and gave me the address.

                  SPLIT
    AMBULANTA STARO RODILIŠTE
         UL. ANTUNA GUSTAVA MATOŠA 2, SPLIT
               Mon-Fri 8-13
                 WED: 13-18

I caught a bus over to Split (about 40min).
I walked to this hospital and found my around to the vaccine desk.
Nobody there. I waited for a bit. Eventually someone appeared and told me that
vaccinations are only on Wednesday.

Oh.
Well.

Grabbed a burek and croissant for lunch.
The home button on my phone is no longer working.
I struggled to enable the on-screen home button.

Never turn on "Switch Control" if your home button doesn't work.
The most frustrating 5 minutes of my life.

I had a look on the site that listed vaccination places.
There was one other place in Split that said they accepted walk-ins.
I headed over to NZJZ building.

Success! They were happy to give me a booster shot of Phizer.

Failure! They couldn't give me the full paperwork because I had received the
first 2 doses overseas.

I received a shot in the arm, plus 2 pieces of paper with details about the vaccination.
I hope that is enough to get into France!

I've e-mailed the NZ Govt with details of my vaccination.
My hope is that can recognise it and add it My Covid Record.
