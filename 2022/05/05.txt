====================

Plan for Saturday:
- Check out of AirBnB
- Catch bus from Trogir to Pirovac
- Pay taxi to get me to Jezera

Plan for Friday:
- Back in Jezera in the afternoon
- How am I getting to Paris?
- What do I need to do pre-entry
- Can I squeeze in an evening with Kelsey & Sven in Zagreb?

Options:
Hitch a ride with someone to Zagreb
Take a bus
Take a train
Fly out of Zadar/Split/Zagreb
Take a night train from Zagreb

Ideally, stay a night near the cost. Then travel to Zagreb saturday
