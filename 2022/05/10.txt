Avg Speed: 5.0kn

TODO
- [x] Purchase NIGHTJET train ticket from ZAGREB to ZURICH
- [ ] Purchase train tricket from ZURICH to PARIS
  - Maybe wait until the day -- might be able to minimize time between trains?
  - How hard is it to get on a train? Really don't want to miss it -- but
    nearly every train I've caught has been pretty easy going - just find the
    station and hop on.
  - Is 15 minutes enough time?
- [x] Let Kelsey know I will be in Zagreb this weekend



Dad is flying to AUSTRALIA tonight - catching an (expensive) shuttle to
Auckland then jumping on a 6am flight. I should check-in with how he his doing.

It was Mother's Day on Sunday -- I forget :(
I should send mum a nice gift, especially because Dad's going to be away for 2 weeks.
Update: I have organised a little gift box of treats from New World to be
delivered on Thursday afternoon - Mum will love that.
