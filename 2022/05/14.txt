Zagreb.
A little overwhelming being back in a big city. 

Out for a morning run. 

Catching up with Kelsey over a coffee and a croissant. 

They have HUMMUS here! I picked up some veggies from the Dolmac market — also picked up a handful of fresh strawberries, the aroma is wonderful.

Thinking about my blog.
I should publish weekly travel notes and photos.
