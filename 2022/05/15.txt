==================

My `plaintext` tool now has any easy way to quickly embed images from Google Photos.

I just right-click on the image and click "Copy Image Link".
Then I paste the URL into the journal, with some special syntax to mark it as an image.
The tool automatically downloads the image, resizes it and saves it into the ./_img directory.

How convenient!
