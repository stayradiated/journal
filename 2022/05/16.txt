GLAVNI KOLODVOR
---------------

Trying to catch the 18:38 overnight train to Zurich.
Arrived at the Zagreb train station around 18:10, plenty of time to spare.
It's not clear from the departures board where I need to go -- I can see a
train leaving at 18:38 but it doesn't mention Zurich.
I ask at the information office. They send me to the ticket office.
I ask at the ticket office. The woman says platform 4.
I find platform 1, 2, 3, 3a and 6. No 4.
The train at 3a leaves at 18:38, there are people waiting. I wait.
Something doesn't feel right. I brush it off as travel anxiety.
However I don't see anyone else with luggage. That's odd. Maybe they are only
travelling a few stops.
The train still hasn't arrived, I walk around the station, I see a train in the
distance, it looks like it has carriages with beds, but there is no one around.
I head back to the station and back to platform 3a. Still no train.
The sign updates, it's not the 18:38 that is arrive anymore.
I decide to ask the ticket office again, on the way back I see a sign for
platform 4.
It's on the other side of the station. I run over there, which is difficult
with all my luggage.
By this time it's 18:48 - the train at station 4 is not the train I want.
The departures board still lists an 18:38 train.
I enquire at the information office, that's not my train.
I missed it.
:(

I chill out at the park.
I purchase another train ticket. This one goes to Münich.
It's not as good, but I don't feel like staying in Zagreb.
I give Marika a call and we chat for a bit.
I head to the train station cafe. I have a beer and get my water bottle refilled.
30 minutes before the train leaves I head to platform 4.
I catch the train.
:)

There is only one other guy in this 6 person booth.
He is from Lake Ohrid in Macedonia.
He was hoping to catch a bus, but the next bus isn't until Thursday.
He is travelling to Salzburg to visit his brother.

The train stops. Police offices get on.
They check my passport. Ask me where I am going. How long I plan to be there.
Why am I travelling.
They stamp my passport.
They talk to the Macedonia guy in Croatian.
They start going through his suitcase, checking everything quite throughly.
They ask him to pack up his bags and escort him out of the booth.
They do a quick check between the seats and in the bin.
Now I am alone in the booth.

Looking at getting some new running shorts.
