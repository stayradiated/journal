Arriving in München at 06:30.
It was a rough night. Sleeping on the chairs is not comfortable, even with an
entire booth to myself.
The ticket inspector kept checking my ticket every hour or so. I was awoken at
4am by the police wanting to check my passport.

Trying to book a ticket to Paris.
Need to use my NZ funds to pay for it, but to do so I need my NZ SIM card to
approve the transaction. It always takes ages for the phone to connect to the
network after swapping the SIM.
Eventually I can approve the payment to thetrainline.com.
However there is an error - I don't get any tickets - but they still have a
lock on my money.
Fortunately I have enough cash available to try again.
The second ticket order fails as well. That's over €250 sitting in limbo.

I decide to try ordering directly through bahn.de.
I find the same train and try to buy a ticket -- but that fails as well!
Fortunately the error happens _before_ the payment. It seems that train is
fully booked?

I go back to thetrainline.com and buy a ticket for a later time.
This time it works! I am going to Paris!

...

On the train to Stuttgart, where I will catch a connecting train to Paris.
Eventually the ticket inspector comes around.
I show her my ticket, no problem.
Then she asks for my BahnCard.
Oh.
I don't have a BahnCard. It expired in January.
I didn't mean to order a ticket with a BahnCard. But I have.
I try to ask if I can just pay the extra 25% - or buy a BahnCard.
She tells me that I have a problem.
One othe other passengers kindly comes over and asks if she can help translate.
I explain the issue, she isn't sure what I should do either.
The ticket inspector is not happy, she is holding my old BahnCard from 2020 and
talking to someone on the phone.
Am I first person she has encountered that has bought a ticket without a
BahnCard? Seems unlikely.
Eventually the ticket inspector walks off.
I buy a 3 month BahnCard on the website -- I have another train to catch after
this and don't want to risk running into an even stricter ticket inspector.
20 minutes later the ticket inspector comes back and I show her the new BahnCard.
She scans the code and seems much happier - as if the train is back in order.
