Walking to the local march√© together.
Marika picks up some fresh eggs, fish and vegetables.

We stop by the bakery on the way back and she buys a croissant, chocolatine and
a baguette.

Marika makes the most delicious lunch.
- Sliced lemons
- Whole piece of Bass fish
- Thyme
- Bayleaves
- Sliced scallions
- Tomatoes
- Potatoes

I had a short nap and it turned into a long nap.

I went for a run around the park

She organises an evening picnic by the Seine.
