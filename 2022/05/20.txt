==================

SQL query to link up account with alternative_account_id:

    UPDATE accounts AS a
    SET alternative_account_id = b.id
    FROM accounts AS b
    WHERE a.id = b.alternative_account_id
      AND a.alternative_account_id IS NULL

This looks cool, but is it actually useful?

SEAGALE
-------

Bought 2 new shirts and a pair of shorts from Seagale.
Tried on their Merino business shirts - but the Small is too big and the XSmall
is too tight around the arms.
I'm not a big fan of the look either.

The guy running the store was pretty cool though.
Even offered me a slice of pizza.
