# BBQ Stuffed Peppers

- 4 Capsicums
- 1 large finely chopped Onion
- 3 cloves minced Garlic
- 1/8 cup chopped Mint
- 1/8 cup chopped Dill
- 1 finely chopped Tomato (seeds removed)
- 1/2 cup uncooked white Rice
- 1/4 cup crumbled Feta
- 1/4 cup grated Cheddar
- 1/2 cup Breadcrumbs

## Instructions

Sauté finely chopped onions, then garlic in olive oil on low heat until soft
and translucent.  Add rice, herbs, spices and tomatoes. Stir to combine
completely.  Cook on low for 5 minutes, stirring often.

Add water, cover and cook on low heat for 15 minutes.  Make sure heat is low or
rice mixture will stick to pan. Remove from heat, uncover, stir and allow to
sit for at least 10 minutes before filling. Rice should be almost completely
cooked.

Mix together remaining ingredients.

At this stage, you can keep filling covered in the refrigerator for up to 3
days until you’re ready to stuff your peppers. When ready to use, allow filling
to sit out for about 30 minutes and come to room temperature.

Cut off the tops of peppers and set aside. Remove seeds and veins and arrange
in a pan which fits them tightly.  For 5 or six medium sized peppers I usually
use a 9 inch round cake pan. For anywhere from 9-12 peppers, I use my 9×13″
cake pan.

Fill each pepper with rice mixture, almost to the top.  Add 2 tsp of warm water
over the top of each filled pepper. Replace pepper lids and carefully brush
tops and sides of filled peppers with olive oil.  Add 1 cup of warm water to
bottom of the pan.

Bake at 375 degrees for 1 1/2 hrs.  Yellow and orange bell peppers can be a bit
thicker skinned and may need another 15 minutes or so. Rice will be soft and
tops of peppers just slightly charred.

A piece of crusty bread and you’ve got a fantastic meal!
