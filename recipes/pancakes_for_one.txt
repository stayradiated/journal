# pancakes for one

## ingredients

- 120g flour
- 8g baking powder
- 10g sugar
- pinch of salt
- 14g melted butter
- 1 large egg
- 183ml milk

## steps

1. combine flour, baking powder, sugar and salt
2. mix butter, egg and milk together
3. make a well in the flour, pour in liquid, stir until _just_ combined - it's
   better to have lumps than to overmix it.
4. place dollop of butter on heated pan, pour a third of the mixture into the pan
5. flip once bubbles appear through pancake
6. repeat until all mixture is gone.
7. eat :)
