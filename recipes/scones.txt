220g all-purpose flour
50g white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
⅛ teaspoon salt
70g unsalted butter (ice cold)
½ cup milk
¼ cup sour cream
⅓ cup dried currants
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon milk

Step 1
Preheat oven to 200 degrees C. 

Step 2
Whisk flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

Step 3
Stir together 1/2 cup milk, sour cream, and currants in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture with a fork until just moistened and holding together.

Step 4
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and pat into rectangle.

Step 5
Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, flatten back into a rectangle, and repeat. Cut into eight pieces and place each scone on a silicone baking mat.

Step 6
Whisk egg and 1 tablespoon milk together in a small bowl; brush mixture on top of each scone.

Step 7
Bake scones in the preheated oven until risen and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove and transfer to cooling rack.
